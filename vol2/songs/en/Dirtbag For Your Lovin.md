# Dirtbag For Your Lovin'

From a window of a kitchen\
I keep a lookout for surprise\
On the faces of the neighbors\
when we’re walking naked by\
\
But expressions they’re expensive \
In this dirty part of town\
Even Jesus and his saviors\
Would be hard pressed for a frown\
\
Guess I’m back to cooking\
In my old lonesome ways\
Chopping everything I get my hands on \
Into a pot and praying\
\
Using alcohol for water\
Mixing rice and chicken bones\
Wishing summer was all over\
And for you to come back home\
\
So come winter, come lonely\
Come time for me to go\
Though I might be here tomorrow\
Know my heart’s already gone\
\
So come crying, come sorrow\
Come time for doing wrong\
I’m a dirtbag for your lovin'\
But I’ve got to let you go\
\
Still it’s summer here and you just called\
To say you’re coming soon\
Though my glass is never empty\
It’s ‘cause I’m drinking like a fool\
\
Who can only write when cooking\
who’s enchanted with the blues\
Always looking for a stranger\
Instead of spending time with you\
\
So come winter, come lonely\
Come time for me to go\
Though I might be here tomorrow\
Know my heart’s already gone\
\
So come crying, come sorrow\
Come time for doing wrong\
I’m a dirtbag for your lovin'\
But I’ve got to let you go\
\
Should I reach for Georgia's peaches\
Be engulfed by Mexico\
All my friends are heading westwards\
Guess it’s time for me to go\
\
Yes I’m ready for the taking\
Severed up my family too\
Since I gave away the mansion\
For some matress time with you\
\
So come winter, come lonely\
Come time for me to go\
Though I might be here tomorrow\
Know my heart’s already gone\
\
So come crying, come sorrow\
Come time for doing wrong\
I’m a dirtbag for your lovin'\
But I’ve got to let you go\
\
So I’ll wrap this song for no one\
But my future self and me\
Put my silent brand new earphones\
And enjoy this here last meal
