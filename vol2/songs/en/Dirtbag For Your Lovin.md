# Dirtbag For Your Lovin'

From a window of a kitchen I keep a lookout for surprise\
On the faces of the neighbors when we’re walking naked by\
But expressions they’re expensive in this dirty part of town\
Even Jesus and his saviors would be hard pressed for a frown\
\
Guess I’m back to cooking, in my old lonesome ways\
Chopping everything I get my hands on into a pot and praying\
Using alcohol for water, mixing rice and chicken bones\
Wishing summer was all over and for you to come back home\
\
So come winter, come lonely, come time for me to go\
Though I might be here tomorrow, know my heart’s already gone\
So come crying, come sorrow, come time for doing wrong\
I’m a dirtbag for your lovin', but I’ve got to let you go\
\
Still it’s summer here and you just called to say you’re coming soon\
Though my glass is never empty, it’s ‘cause I’m drinking like a fool\
Who can only write when cooking, who’s enchanted with the blues\
Alway longing for a stranger, ‘stead of spending time with you\
\
So come …\
\
Should I go for Georgia's peaches, be engulfed by Mexico\
All my friends are heading westwards, guess it’s time for me to go\
Yes I’m ready for the taking, severed up my family too\
Since I gave away the mansion for some matress time with you\
\
So come …\
\
So I’ll wrap this song for no one, but my future self and me\
Put my silent brand new earphones and enjoy this here last meal\
