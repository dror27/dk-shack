# In The Garden, In Groups Of Six

She tells me, next Monday, she’s heading into town\
So two weeks from now, I should join if I’m around\
They’re missing just a person, to get them up to six\
And in case I can not make it, I better tell them quick\
\
‘Cause them slots, they keep on filling, there’s life here on the line\
There are bottles to be had, and casserole with thyme\
And this here said occasion is scheduled to be prime\
It's lacking me in body, to make it all just rhyme \
\
In the garden, in groups of six\
Dating neighbours, sipping drinks\
But undercover, we're playing tricks\
In the garden, in groups of six\
\
Now being extra careful, has never been my thing\
I push it just enough, so I can feel it sting\
A garden is for flowers, group sex not my kink\
So if you were to come, I’ll probably make a stink\
\
But if you’ll take this invite, and come up to the moor\
We’ll dance around the sunshine, and slowly drift some more\
And when we’re finally ready, we’ll open up that door\
Ain’t that what it’s all about, the reason you came here for?\
\
In the garden, in groups of six\
Being social, holding our piss\
But undercover, we're a bunch of hicks\
In the garden, in groups of six\
\
But you are a continent a-far, so should I just concede\
Dampen my emotions, subside on chicken feed\
Your texts were so forthcoming,  in killing down the scene\
"Flower power is over, and you’re not but a kid"\
\
But I shall keep on trying, expose myself in song\
Until the dam wall gives, until no right be wrong\
Our body is a temple, desire not all gone\
I’m ready for forgiving, tomorrow’s just a morn'\
\
In the garden, in groups of six\
Dating neighbours, sipping drinks\
But undercover, we're playing tricks\
In the garden, in groups of six\
\
In the garden, in groups of six\
Being social, holding our piss\
But undercover, we're a bunch of hicks\
In the garden, in groups of six
