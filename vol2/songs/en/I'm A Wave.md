# I'm A Wave

Making myself heavy \
Just to float back up again \
Like zeppelin in heaven\
Misspelling my own name\
\
Released back to the sky\
Given to no end\
To my intake of poison \
My quest for the grand\
\
I’m a wave, a formula of crave\
\
Stuffing my stomach \
For being crude\
I’m supposedly healthy\
But all that time a fool\
\
Till tides come flooding in \
From the breadths of my own thighs\
Now I'm climbing Bolehill\
For the guilt to subside\
\
I’m a wave, a formula of crave\
Unknown, now I’m gone \
\
Dipping deep down under\
Where leaded trouble lies\
Into the smelting fire\
Where once a flood light shined\
\
On a town I once called home\
On a girl’s down curl I once cut\
In room now demolished\
Just to be built-up from scraps\
\
I’m a wave, a formula of crave\
Unknown, now I’m gone \
\
I have harden with the years\
Swallowed all of my tears\
Overcame most of my fears\
Fucked some of my own peers
