# Time She's A Woman

She enters the hallway\
Alone in her silver\
Yellow shining dress\
Her threshold conceals\
\
Out here the dogs\
Are ready for feeding\
The game of the night\
Is about to begin\
\
Stall as you may\
You’re destined to enter\
Her corridor of wonders\
Her tunnel of love\
\
There in the darkness\
The water runs easy\
Caveman drawings\
Of horses and doves\
\
'Cause time she’s a fast running old woman\
Chase her you’d be breathless\
Stop her you’ll die\
But all of her wonders\
Are here for the taking\
The minutes, the hours\
The breadth of her thigh\
\
You’re tall as a pine\
Soft as an straw\
Feathered as a moose\
Who's about to be sheared\
\
Keen as the meadows\
Orange in color\
Happy as a baby\
Stinging as a bee\
\
'Cause time she’s a fast ...\
\
Chalk mark they’d lead you\
So follow them gently\
Spare the illusion\
Your critical eyes\
\
Lost in a mirror\
Reflections are fading\
Bodies to enter\
Forthwith to unite\
\
'Cause time she’s a fast ...\
\
Life ain’t for ever\
The young ones are saying\
Life’s but a dream\
The sleepless returns\
And I’m but an old man\
With thoughts high as mountains\
And lowly desires\
Keeping me thin\
\
The Chesapeake river\
It flows to the ocean\
Unnamed the fish\
Who bed on its stream\
\
Unknown my love\
Her name but a token\
Given at birth\
She’s now a-waiting on me\
\
'Cause time she’s a fast ...
