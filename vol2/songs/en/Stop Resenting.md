# Stop Resenting

Lyrics: Scott Pilgrim - Launchpad McQuack\
\
I / can't be sure\
but I think I heard you / crawl through the door,\
You / didn't say a word\
And I think you tried to go to bed / but instead you went to floor\
\
You've been out drinking with the other boys again\
Telling them we're only friends\
Making out and making noise,\
\
Oh, Stop pretending / that this isn't really ending,\
And I will stop resenting you / when you stop resenting me\
\
I / waited up late\
Maybe / a bit too late\
until you / finally came in\
Where do I end / and where do you begin,\
You've been out partying with the guys I've never met,\
Drinking beer and smoking cigarettes,\
Killing brain cells and killing me,\
\
Oh, stop pretending that this isn't really ending,\
And I will stop resenting you when you stop resenting me\
