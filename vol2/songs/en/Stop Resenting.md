# Stop Resenting

(lyrics: Scott Pilgrim - Launchpad McQuack)\
\
I can't be sure\
But I think I heard you crawl through the door\
You didn't say a word\
And I think you tried to go to bed but instead you went to the floor\
\
You've been out drinking with the other boys again\
Telling them we're only friends\
Making out and making noise\
\
Oh, Stop pretending that this isn't really ending\
And I will stop resenting you when you stop resenting me\
\
I waited up late\
Maybe a bit too late\
Until you finally came in\
Where do I end and where do you begin\
You've been out partying with the guys I've never met\
Drinking beer and smoking cigarettes\
Killing brain cells and killing me\
\
Oh, stop pretending that this isn't really ending\
And I will stop resenting you when you stop resenting me
