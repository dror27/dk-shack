# War Is A-Coming

(translated from Hebrew)\
\
War is a-coming girl\
Launder them sheets\
We’ll hang in shelters\
Reading the papers, watching flicks\
\
War is a-coming girl\
Stash away them kids\
We’ll be hitting the bed soon\
Counting rockets for sheep\
\
And all the while\
Heaven’s a folk-dancing ballroom in swing\
Missiles are kissing, what a thing!\
Our bed has thrown in the towel, you win\
Fear of God - out the ring\
Still, my neighbor reads, Psalms and hymns\
\
War is a-coming girl\
No cloud is in sight\
The white doves all hawked\
Madness our town's plight\
\
Let’s get the hell out of here, you say\
Deck our passports flush\
We’ll travel to foreign lands\
Buy rainbow sheets, make them blush\
\
And all the while\
Heaven’s a folk-dancing ballroom in swing\
Missiles are kissing, what a thing!\
Our bed has thrown in the towel, you win\
Fear of God - out the ring\
Still, my neighbor reads, Psalms and hymns\
\
How about we head down the beach\
Its peaceful as spring, except for some fish\
Bag some grapes, an apple, a peach\
The bathroom’s deserted, will you be my dish?\
\
And all the while\
Heaven’s a folk-dancing ballroom in swing\
Missiles are kissing, what a thing!\
Our bed has thrown in the towel, you win\
Fear of God - out the ring\
Alas, my neighbor no longer reads, neither Psalms nor hymns\
\
Because war is a-coming\
Wash down them whites\
Thread the needle right\
Sew them flags, white\
\
Yes, war is a-coming\
Wash down them whites\
Thread the needle tight\
Shrouds are on order, tonight
