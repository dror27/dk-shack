# Again

She's a race horse on the run\
Doesn't bother anyone\
Her moon and her sun\
Pretty soon they'd be gone\
She's dark as a storm\
Been holding for so long\
\
Radicals they build\
But there're happy to destroy\
Confusion sinks in\
Is it a girl or a boy?\
Look him in the eye\
You're in for a surprise\
\
And time again\
A whole world pretends \
That it's alright\
To simply ask her to bend\
And open up\
Take it in as a friend\
And keep on smiling \
As he comes in her hand\
\
As if you're hooked on a chain\
For him to rattle for gain \
\
Again\
\
You've been running in the streets\
You've been searching for pain\
Scratching your head\
Oh, are you Abel or Cain \
Your story been told, \
You've been bought and sold\
\
And time again\
A whole world pretends \
That it's alright\
To simply ask him to bend\
And open up\
Take it in as a man\
And keep on smiling \
As he comes in your hand\
\
As if you're hooked on a chain\
For them to rattle for gain\
\
Again\
\
Aren't we all\
Basically friends\
Supernatural\
Naked and grand\
All polymaths\
Lovers insane\
Here juxtaposed\
Twirling for fame\
\
As if we're hooked on a chain\
For us to rattle profane\
Sink down as bottoms, un-shamed\
Rise as tops, just like cranes\
\
Again\
\
And time again\
A whole world pretends \
That it's alright\
To simply ask her to bend\
And open up\
Take it in as a friend\
And keep on smiling \
As he comes in her hand\
\
As if you're hooked on a chain\
For them to rattle for gain\
\
Again\
