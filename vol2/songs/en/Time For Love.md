# Time For Love

(in progress)\
\
So many things I've left unnoticed\
So many things I've left undone\
Ever since we both left the office\
You were on a run\
You were already gone\
\
So many people I've left behind\
Up and down they stomp my spine\
Since that time, that you were mine\
So many people left behind\
\
And now the time has come for love\
Now the time has come for getting up\
Flying high as doves\
Into the skies\
My love\
\
So many thoughts I had, but now they're gone\
For almost two years here, I've been on my own\
There're nothing to eat\
The house is a mess,\
Smells like a pit\
\
And now it's time, time for love\
Time for pulling out the stops\
Fly high as doves\
\
I got the car waiting warm in the garage\
I got you hanging by my side\
Ain't that enough?\
People say I'm a lone\
Guess I'm coming back,\
On my own\
\
'Cause now it's time for love\
It's time for you and me\
Fly high as doves
