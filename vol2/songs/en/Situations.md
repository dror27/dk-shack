# Situations

I got a head strong\
Like a million plates of steel\
And a vision\
I can never quite fulfill\
But if I show up on your porch tonight\
I’ll probably will get killed ...\
\
Situations ...\
They’re coming back again\
Where its going\
Oh really ...\
I don’t care!\
\
I got me a mission\
To eradicate all hate\
And a group of people\
Doing every thing I say\
But if I tell them to go hug a tree\
They cut it down instead ...\
\
Situations ...\
They’re coming back again\
Where its going\
Oh really ...\
I don’t care!
