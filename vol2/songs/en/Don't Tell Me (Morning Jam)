# Don't Tell Me (Morning Jam)

Don’t tell me I’m wrong\
Or I might judge you\
I have every right in the book\
To write this song about you\
You’re not the prettiest girl, lies been old\
Yes its true, I’m getting old\
Don’t tell me I’m wrong\
Or I might judge you\
\
Don’t tell me I’m strong\
Or I might hurt you\
You own the store but not the floor\
Although you think you do\
I heard so many stories, people are saying\
That you’re telling them you’re coming my way\
So, don’t tell me I’m strong\
Or I might hurt you\
\
Don’t tell me I’m slow\
Or I might race you\
You know that finishing line is getting awful close\
So I might chase you\
I’ll be there in the hours of the night\
When no one else around you\
There might be someone you can trust\
But it ain’t me\
So, don’t tell me I’m slow, or strong\
Or judgemental, or weak or long\
\
Don’t tell me I’m soft\
Or I might love you\
‘Cause I know, baby, that you’re the one\
That I can get to\
One smile is all it takes\
To crack you smile, to get you wanting me\
Don’t tell me I’m soft\
Or I might love you\
\
… tell me I’m soft\
I think I … I already love you\
\
Don’t tell me I’m old\
‘Cause I might leave you\
I got enough people around me\
Telling me that I can’t be you\
Bugging around, telling me …\
Here’s the thing I got to be\
Don’t tell me I’m old\
‘Cause I might leave you\
\
Don’t tell me to end this song\
‘Cause I might just do that too\
There’ve been many times I went along\
Now I don’t want to\
You can do whatever you want\
I’m simply here, take what want\
Don’t tell me to write this song\
‘Cause I might just do that too\
