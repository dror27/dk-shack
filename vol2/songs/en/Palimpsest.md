# Palimpsest

Great painters have always been known\
To paint over a piece, its magic now gone\
With white, short of fixing new canvas to a frame\
Lest that picture would speak and thus put them to shame\
\
A painter I’m not, so I could not tell\
But plenty of painters and pieces I’ve failed\
Been covered in white, brie, feathers and soothe\
Rose time and again, shrouds-fed my roots\
\
For not surface-bound was this our encounter\
Unterwelt its natural harbor\
But to set it a-sailing onto horizons\
It needs be floating, free as a bison\
\
More than a sense\
Of purpose and plan\
Esthetics and faith \
Acknowledgement mends\
\
In words, sight\
A smile and a tone\
A new child is born\
Sans burying a faun
