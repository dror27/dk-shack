# Brown-baggin'

A man pushing a stroller\
No baby inside\
Just his life, turned over\
Got nothing to hide\
\
But me I’m still walking\
That very fine line\
Of looking and clean and sober\
Brown-baggin' the wine\
\
You call yourself freedom\
But you turn a blind eye\
To the chains you’ve keeping\
To the pennies and dimes\
\
You walk around naked\
In your bedroom and sigh\
For the fucking love of Jesus\
Won’t you give in a try\
\
Expose your true nature\
Top, bottom and sides\
All welcome, the sign says\
‘Cause now its your time\
\
Be abundant in feelings\
Shine like a star\
Find the elusive\
The Waded down, marred\
