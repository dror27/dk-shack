# Brand New Song

I got loads of free time \
But I can’t tell a soul \
I got seven lovers on Skype \
But I can’t bring them home \
Still, I got a brand new song \
So I guess there ain’t nothing wrong \
\
I got 2 million people under occupation \
But I can’t hire so much as a chef \
I got 4 police investigation on my name \
So I can’t brag about my wealth \
Still, I got a brand new song \
Ain’t that something else? \
\
Now you know why most heads of state \
Keep a secret drawer full of poems \
It’s the only way they can be outing themselves \
Crossdressing with decorum \
\
But a song is like a gun in court \
A rolling bottle down a theatre wrought \
Something so loaded, with honesty froth \
That's why it's shunned by normal folks\
\
I’ll got three balls, \
Well now you know that too \
And a seafaring maiden in every port \
And a jet fighter too \
And I got a brand new song \
I bet you care about that too \
And I got a brand new song \
You must be loving it too \
\
Now you know why most heads of state \
Keep a secret drawer full of poems \
It’s the only way they can be outing themselves \
Crossdressing with decorum \
\
But a song is like a gun in court \
A rolling bottle down a theatre wrought \
Something so loaded, with honesty froth \
That's why it's shunned by normal folks\
\
So now I’m the head of a state \
With no borders and laws at all \
There’s just one small test \
To see if you can sing along \
Yes I got a brand new song \
So I guess there’s nothing wrong
