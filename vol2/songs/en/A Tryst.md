# A Tryst

Bosom of Europe\
Fig milk sweet as corn\
Eastern bondage carriage\
Return voyage forelonged\
\
Where Grands fished\
Oblivious of me following kin\
Down a villager’s well-bucketing arm\
Muscle vales as buried fins\
\
Here I’m surname-locale\
Perched at the tributary source\
Chosen people’s statehood perks\
Drizzle off, as nature snorts\
\
Not to be revered or explained,\
Nor it be your conversation piece\
But a private, solitary affair\
A tryst
