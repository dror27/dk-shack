# Little Girl's Dreams

They beat him hard, till he just couldn’t walk\
Just because he wouldn’t talk the talk\
Sent him outside to wait in the rain\
Until his mother got over the pills and the pain\
\
Now his buddies are waiting, money in hand\
Dummies they are so he’ll just pretend\
Strip-joint is empty, 3:20 am\
Throw her a hundred, she’ll make you a man\
\
As I swing 'round the pole my mind’s in a heap\
Still my body is ready for the next trick\
I keep my eyes closed, not to be seen\
Forget what you know about a little girl’s dreams\
\
On the way home we brag and we cheer\
Almost forgetting the horror and fear\
Of bodies muffled, snapped to a click\
Now you be a good girl, we came here for kicks\
\
As I swing 'round the pole my mind’s in a heap\
Still my body is ready for the next trick\
I keep my eyes closed, not to be seen\
Forget what you know about a little girl’s dreams\
\
We’ll kill them all, my girlfriend she says\
But she really means the dreams in your head\
Get us a van, paint it in blue\
Surf out the winter, just me and you\
\
Still I swing 'round the pole, my mind’s in a heap\
Still my body is ready for the next trick\
I keep my eyes closed, not to be seen\
Forget what you know about a little girl’s dreams
