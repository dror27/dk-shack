# Bowl of Trix

The knife was sharp\
The cut deep, deep enough\
But no blood\
No gushing of any kind,\
No hearts were damaged\
In this crushing of kind\
\
But still, I got a free fix\
A great big bowl of Trix\
Into heaven agazing I peeked\
Sneak snake by the gate\
Do animals kill or hate?\
\
Evanescence feeding crescents\
Freeing my mind in earnest\
To follow mythical deserts\
She beckons me fervent\
Feverish as a ghost\
Riding high on cosmic coasts\
\
But still, I got a free fix\
A great big bowl of Trix\
Into heaven agazing I peeked\
Sneak snake by the gate\
Do animals kill or hate?\
Underneath the substrate\
Every wind sounds chafe\
To no restraint abides my faith\
\
Chirp chirp fest fest\
To be a beat-creep is the best\
No signs of glam or clam\
Damm damm, trained she clangs\
Her ebony dark stench\
Forever here to stay\
Stray astray I stray\
Today\
\
But still, I got a free fix\
A great big bowl of Trix\
Into heaven agazing I peeked\
Sneak snake by the gate\
Do animals kill or hate?\
Underneath the substrate\
Every wind sounds chafe\
To no restraint abides my faith
