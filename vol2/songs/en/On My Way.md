# On My Way

Rest your head on my shoulders \
Close your eyes and pray\
Babe, I’m getting closer\
I’m on my way\
\
Although I’m right now in Texas\
On a long and dusty highway\
Not knowing where I am\
Or where I’m gonna stay\
\
My heart is wrapped up in a box\
Ready for check-in at the curb\
If I make it to the terminal alive\
In the morning I’ll be there\
\
The air is chocolate sweet here\
The sky is dark as your eyes\
If I called you up right now\
Would you leave it all and fly\
\
And ride with me tomorrow\
Wherever the road will take\
Not knowing where we are\
Or where we’re gonna stay\
\
I’ll put my head on your shoulders\
Close my eyes and pray\
Babe, are you getting closer\
Please be on your way\
\
Though this is just a song, Babe\
I know it travels well\
Like the AM stations of old\
It’s bouncing off the air\
\
So turn your radio on, girl\
Listen to the breeze\
Somewhere at the end of the dial\
You can hear me saying please\
\
Rest your head on my shoulders \
Close your eyes and pray\
Babe, I’m getting closer\
I’m on my way
