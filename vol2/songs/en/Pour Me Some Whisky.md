# Pour Me Some Whisky

Pour me some whisky\
Until I’m dead and gone\
Till the sun’s tucked back to bed\
Till the stars have all shown\
Till the rain has all fallen\
And the winds all turn to snow\
Pour me some whisky\
Till I’m dead and gone\
\
Pour me some whisky\
Until I’m dead and gone\
‘Till I’m safe back in your heaven\
Whole and all alone\
‘Till the sky opens up\
For angles singalong\
Pour me some whisky\
For I’m dead and gone\
\
Pour me some whisky\
Till I’m safe and sound again\
Never will I walk the darkness \
Without you as a friend\
For the gates to swing open\
To accept me in again\
Pour me some whisky\
Oh … won’t you be my friend\
\
Pour me some whisky\
Soothe my aching body and soul\
I’ve been walking the desert\
Like a child that has no home\
Now I’m coming, to your graveyard\
For my final judgement call\
Pour me some whisky\
Before I’m dead and gone\
\
Final judgement, it is real\
Lord I’m ready, for the fall\
I’ve been walking to your mansion\
Towards your palaces of gold\
Now I feel the door knob’s turning\
Is there anybody home?\
Pour me some whisky\
Before I’m dead and gone\
\
Pour me some whisky\
On this my final waking day\
I’ll be coming home\
Without a thing to say\
In the final hour\
Of my very last day\
Pour me some whisky\
And I’ll be on my way\
\
Pour me some whisky\
Till my soul says it is dry\
For I’ve been thirsty as a canyon\
Angry as the tide\
And on your flower bed\
I want to lay my head and sob\
Pour me some whisky\
‘Till soul feels proud and whole\
\
Pour me some whisky\
I’ve been smiling for too long\
Oh, I need that drink so bad\
To make me feel alone\
Most days, loneliness \
Suits me just fine\
So pour me some whisky\
For I’m out of wine\
\
Pour me some whisky\
‘Cause I run out of things to say\
A drink will end it all\
And send me away\
For I’ve been down and out and cold\
On the road today\
Lord ,Pour me some whisky\
If you really want me to stay
