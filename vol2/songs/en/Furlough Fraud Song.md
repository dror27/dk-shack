# Furlough Fraud Song

Steve and Anne, a fictitious couple\
Own and run a small shop\
Mending bicycles for the town\
\
They’ve been in business for twenty years now\
John, their son, has recently joined full time\
Things were looking up\
\
Then COVID hit, customer traffic slowed\
John went on furlough, while Steve and Anne\
Kept the store open to serve community cyclists.\
\
When Steve’s back pain returned,\
John stepped to work again\
Money was tight so John stayed on furlough,\
\
Doing a good deed for his dad.\
(being a good fellow)\
\
Unbeknownst to him,\
John was committing (Furlough Fraud,)\
A serious criminal offence,\
So I’m told\
\
Little did he know\
He was a target for a manhunt also\
A hundred million pounds\
Out for his soul\
\
What is a Furlough Fraud after all?\
\
Well, furlough fraud occurs when an employer\
Deliberately claims back wages\
under the job retention scheme\
\
For an employee they know\
Is carrying out work for them.\
Silently, behind the scene\
\
But Furlough Fraud can take other forms as well\
Such as claiming funds for staff that’s no longer there\
Asking employees to take certain levels of pay cuts\
While claiming their full furlough government grant\
\
Furloughing employees without letting them know\
Asking staff to ‘volunteer’ while under furlough\
To continue to work hidden back on their homes\
Not to mention holding all or part of their pay\
\
Or simply,\
as Patrick Cannon, Barrister at law, writes:\
\
“Employees on furlough cannot do any work\
for their employer” day or night\
\
But little did he know\
He was a target for a manhunt also\
A hundred million pounds\
Out for his soul
