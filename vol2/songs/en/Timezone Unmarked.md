# Timezone Unmarked

How many times a day can you check \
The current time in Sydney? \
It’ll still be on the other side of earth \
Even if she’s now marked as “busy” \
\
You think your thoughts can travel \
Close to the surface \
Like a missile that’s gone rogue \
And touch her slender body, and do no wrong \
Daylight for you almost gone \
\
You’re in a timezone unmarked \
Light and darkness got no meaning \
No one can keep you tuned \
To a heart that keeps no feelings \
\
And still you check on the time \
She was last seen connected \
To the world of things \
Where you can only sing \
About the way it used to be \
\
Does she think of you \
When she’s roaming seas and peaks? \
Or is she forgetful as a bird, will she ever speak? \
Does she think of you \
When she’s in bed, before she asleep \
Or is she over and out, will she ever speak of you?\
\
So you practice dignity \
As your heart keeps on shrinking \
Traveling the other way \
Makes her hard for reaching \
\
And still you’re well aware \
Of every breath she’s talking \
In a world that’s in your head \
Where love is timeless, never dead \
Hearing voices got you scared \
\
Does she think of you \
When she’s roaming seas and peaks? \
Or is she forgetful as a bird, will she ever speak? \
Does she think of you \
When she’s in bed, before she asleep \
Or is she over and out, will she ever speak of you?
