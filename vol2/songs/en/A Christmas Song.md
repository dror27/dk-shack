# A Christmas Song

Take your black dress off\
Powder your nose\
Ethereal justice\
Is melting like snow\
\
Keep them high heels on\
There’s no running away\
Come ‘round the sofa\
It’s Christmas today\
\
Yes I’m old and decrepit\
A senator of sorts \
You might not be eager\
To please me the most\
\
But your wish now will be \
My solemn command\
Just say yes\
I’m recording the sound\
\
I bet you’ve already heard\
Stories about me\
Well, nothing is true\
I am what you see\
\
Just a lonely survivor\
A heart-shaped as a man\
Won’t you be a real darling\
Come hold my hand\
\
And take your black dress off\
Powder your nose\
Ethereal justice\
Is melting like snow \
\
High morals and trumpets\
Are blowing me off\
But they’re not here, with us\
Oh my, you’re so soft\
\
We’ll keep it right here\
Tucked under a stone\
Your dream job is a-waiting\
Just open the door\
\
If you’ve got a tear, it’s probably because of me\
I’m not that stupid, I know what you see\
Just an old joke, lame as it can be\
Keeping us in deep travesty \
\
Now the media is onto us, damn the numbers, I will pay\
But they got deeper pockets, so they say\
Go on, tell it all, I’ll be leaving anyway\
Keep that dress that I gave you, because It’s Christmas today\
\
So keep your black dress on girl\
Powder your nose\
Ethereal justice\
Is melting like snow\
\
Keep them high heels on\
It’s better this way\
You won’t be running\
Well, at least not today\
