# Deflecting

It’s noon on a weekday\
And I’ve already done my share\
Of sending five rejections\
Of fending off the gale\
\
Of opportunities and romantic crushes\
That seems to be hitting my door\
But none of them seem to matter\
Since hung up the phone on you call\
\
When I’m done deflecting\
I’ll carry you in exposed\
Into the darkness of my memories\
Into the brightness of soul\
\
Yes, its true, I’m the greatest\
Deflector of all that is kind\
If it comes in a package I’ll return it\
If it show on my doorstep, I won’t sign\
\
When I’m done deflecting ...\
\
I’ve built up a wall, to surround me complete\
Set my armour in place, I've taken no defeat\
But your simplest of love, it just waltzed down the street\
Caught me empty handed, knocked my right off my feet\
\
Now your memory still echoes, in the halls of my retreat\
You gave me the grand prize, a man must admit\
And as deflecting is my art form, I gave you the royal treat\
Sent you back to castle, forever not to speak
