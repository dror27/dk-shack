# Dethrone

Dethrone prematurely\
A queen of love\
Make her a muse\
\
Save no pictures\
Keep them inside\
Sing the blues\
\
Work your magic\
Play the game\
Thinking got you\
Tangled in her name\
\
Eat bananas\
Wash the pots\
Wait for christmas\
Go count the votes\
\
Fix the bets\
Tilt the table\
Rig the machine\
\
Make her happy\
Make her sad\
She’s a-livin in a dream\
\
Soon you be spreadeagled\
On the floor\
Waiting for the countdown\
For the bells to toll\
\
MC hungry \
For the mic\
Countdown’s over\
Tyson mike\
\
Surmon master\
Reader of charts\
Language juggler at the door\
Let him in\
It be tomorrow\
Not a single day before\
\
Chase the sunset\
Make it stand\
Be your slave\
Obey command\
\
Feed her chocolate\
Till she cries\
Tell her stories\
Spare no lies\
\
On to happiness\
On to fame\
On to gloat\
\
Fast forward quickly\
Across them parts\
Better left alone\
\
Write the song\
Before she turns\
From a muse\
Back to a queen\
\
Commit to tape\
Reel the machine\
Tell the public\
Make a scene\
\
Surmon master\
Reader of charts\
Language juggler at the door\
Let him in\
It be tomorrow\
Not a single day before
