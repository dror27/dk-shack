# Collecting Favors Owed

I’m gonna start collecting\
On all the favors that I’m owed\
I’m gonna feed my hunger\
On all them seeds that I once sowed\
\
I’m gonna get evicted\
And walk right back through your front door\
Yes, I’m gonna start collecting\
On all the favors that I’m owed\
\
I’m gonna get you ready\
From your head down to your toes\
Slip under the covers\
Bring you back into the fold\
\
Surprised it never happened\
These are desperate times I’m told\
I’m gonna start collecting\
On all the favors that I’m owed\
\
They say disparity\
Mates the arrow to the bow\
My springs are loaded\
Comes what may, a friend, a foe\
\
We’re way past justice\
Now it’s time for all out war\
I’m gonna get collecting\
On all the favors that I’m owed\
\
Maybe tomorrow\
Or some other day I’m bold\
Behind civility\
Lies a child who closed the door\
\
My knees are shaking\
I got feelings too, you know\
So I’m gonna get collecting\
On all them favors that I’m owed\
\
"The journey’s never ending\
No escape from work and toil\
Be prepared for bending\
‘Cause in their minds you’re just a toy”\
\
Voices I’ve been hearing\
Ever since I was a boy\
"Always walk a straight line\
Do exactly as you’re told"\
\
"Mind the weather\
Stir your boat back onto shore\
The love you’ll find in Jesus\
Is the one you’re looking for"\
\
Way past final judgement\
Mortal sins now to explore\
So I’d better start collecting\
On all them favors that I’m owed
