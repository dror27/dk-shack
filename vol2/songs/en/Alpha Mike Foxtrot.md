# Alpha Mike Foxtrot

My home town is the kind of a place\
Where everyone was once someone else, the best\
A general with a water gun\
A pilot who’s destined to destroy Iran, what fun!\
\
But I’m neither, nor not or \
Gates I flip my finger for\
Flop houses too\
I just wanna be in love with you\
\
Then I became a king of folk\
In bar-rooms of aging men and smoke, I spoke\
Girls would say: here comes he\
But all that I wanted was to get out and pee, and be\
\
Yes, I’m neither, nor not or\
Toggle switch baits I ignore\
Not any more\
I just wanna be with you on all fours\
\
Now you might take me for a misanthrope\
A cynical recluse, an anarchist dope\
A dog eat dog world was just a hoax\
It’s a god meets the ever turning sword of hope\
\
So you better start sniffing real ass\
Join the party boy, lick boots of brass\
Be a contributing citizen of the nation\
Support this wonderful god-dammed creation\
\
Be happy you’re allowed to stay infected\
By a network of such glorious stations\
With talking heads that sing on command\
Roar as you may, we can’t hear a sound\
\
The past is gone, present perfect it is, \
With our newly appointed constellation of queers\
Just be a sport, come join us down at the bar\
On the corner of something stupid and our trash-talking czar\
\
Drink what you’re served, boy, don’t ask why\
We’ll tell you who you are, and then you’ll die\
Raise your head, look at the sky\
God’s flying a Cessna, writing your future on high\
\
Blink once and it be gone\
Anyway, soon you’ll bravely be under a stone\
We’ll keep up the flag, nation above all\
Be here to love us, you poet of old\
\
But I’m neither, nor not or\
In your circuit, I’m “the great bore”\
Just a chip off the old block\
Alpha Mike Foxtrot \
\
“So much hate this guy has\
Wish we could have trained him instead\
To dress in whites, to accept\
Divinity, order, leaders inept\
\
Weep for him no more\
He’s just driftwood, swept onto our shore\
It’s anthem time now, bow your head \
kiss the floor, sing this instead:”\
\
The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
