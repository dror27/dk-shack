# Nocturnal Premonitions

All roads they lead\
To the inner of your thighs\
Like the Nile’s unyielding delta\
In triangle land we'll die\
\
Godly sermons sing\
Not a single lullaby\
Dark as night the hymns\
For laying silent by your side\
\
Faults of man akin\
To jet line drawings ‘cross the sky\
Woman nurtures, but a king\
Feeds on crumbs, free of pies \
\
Seven are the sins of love\
Count them up, don’t ask why\
Rest now, on forgotten wings\
Into oblivion soon you’ll fly\
\
All God's dangers, put to writing\
Resolutions bears this not\
Hereby given, unfair warning\
Tide is turning, sink the boat the fly\
\
Every pit onto I stumble\
Every busy track I cross\
Spare me human, spare me humble\
Fetch the gangplank, nail the cross\
\
Ready for the hanging\
In the grand old market square\
All good virtue will be fairing\
Dogs my flesh allowed to tear\
\
All God's dangers, put to writing\
Resolutions bears this not\
Hereby given, unfair warning\
Tide is turning, sink the boat the fly\
\
Rulers of domains\
Classifiers of all thought\
Savory moments I am gaining\
As you drag me out your plot\
\
For it is bonding as a chain\
Gagging as ball\
To lay here silent in refrain\
In the face of love so tall\
\
All God's dangers, put to writing\
Resolutions bears this not\
Hereby given, unfair warning\
Tide is turning, sink the boat the fly\
