# Old Mining Towns

Once I did leave her\
Out of sight, out of mind\
Her past all forgiven\
Far left behind\
\
But she’s so relentless\
Glorious and kind\
So I fell right back in to\
Her darkest of mines\
\
Morning it’s time\
To climb up a hill\
For leaving her now\
Breathless you’ll feel\
Old mining towns\
They’re still testing your skills\
Down at the pit\
Ancient souls dance and cheer\
\
Newcomer turned mayor\
In this change of a town\
Future’s up for grabs\
Past but a frown\
\
Still she keeps an old picture\
Tucked to her door\
Of bartending woman\
Good-old Grandma Torr\
\
Morning it’s time ...\
\
Though she never stopped trying\
To be artsy and fair\
Those who were born here\
Can pretty sure tell\
\
Of her darkened figure\
Of her long nights of snow\
Of her beauty now hidden\
In her maze down below\
\
Morning it’s time ...
