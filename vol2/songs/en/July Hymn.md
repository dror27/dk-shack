# July Hymn

It's almost July now\
Six months into this thing\
Fingers tired of typing\
Eyes of watching but screens\
\
Though alive and healthy\
Higher aspirations are surely abound\
To dream, to desire, to be found\
Where else but in this town?\
\
('cause) This is the new normal\
Daily reports, closings and openings\
Personal peace, manufactured unrest\
And donâ€™t forget, Global Warming!\
There's just so much to protest\
\
We plan, we manage, then we wait\
Prepare, stay safe and awake\
But how about venturing afar\
Stumbling for days, starting the car?\
\
Surely it's possible, but is it welcomed still?\
Our ever adaptive spirit, now trained\
Not only by society and government\
For its own safety to be caged in facial garment\
\
This is the new normal ...\
\
It's time to be moving\
In spite of it all\
To be in space\
In spirit, in soul\
\
Like them foxes and birds\
Their freedom found anew\
Freely roam we will too\
Ideas and countries sans-flu\
\
Yes, we will certainly head out\
To be again succumbed\
By all that is alive\
To be in love\
\
This is the new normal ...\
\
...\
And don't forget global warming\
LGBT rights, women's polling\
Ukraine is falling\
My mind is blowing\
Otherwise I would be calling\
Free of care I will be rolling\
But now I'm just scrolling\
Through a screen that's full of moaning\
While countless bands are falling\
We'll still be here comes morning\
Oh, there's so much more to care for ... 'cause\
This is the new normal ...
