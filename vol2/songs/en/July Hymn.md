# July Hymn

It's almost July now\
Six months into this thing\
Fingers tired of typing Pandemic\
Eyes of watching but screens\
\
Though alive and active\
Higher aspirations are abound\
To dream, to desire, to be surprising\
In this here town?\
\
We plan, manage, wait,\
Prepare, stay safe, awake\
But how about venturing afar\
Stumbling for days, starting the car?\
\
Surely possible, but welcomed still?\
Our ever adaptive spirit, now trained\
Not only by society and government\
For its own safety to be caged in facial garment, estranged\
\
This is the new normal\
Daily reports, closings and openings,\
Personal peace, manufactured unrest\
And donâ€™t forget, Global Warming! Trump-o-fest!\
\
Time to be moving,\
In spite of it all.\
To be in space,\
in spirit, in soul\
\
Like them foxes and birds\
Their freedom found anew,\
Freely roam we will\
Ideas and countries aflu\
\
And so we head out,\
To be again secombed\
By all that is alive,\
To be in love\
