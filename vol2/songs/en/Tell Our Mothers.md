# Tell Our Mothers

Tell our mothers not to cry no more\
Peace and love songs done it all\
Tell our sisters not to fight no more\
Someone just posted an App for that on the Apple store\
\
Now we never ask why\
Except when the old phone’s battery dies\
Or when we’re bingeing and the streaming stalls\
On account of a hurricane’s eye getting awfully close\
\
Tell our mothers  ...\
\
Now we never ask how\
They’ve drained the swamp down but still we drowned alive\
In a sewer called “Great Again”\
Run by an arse for his own gain\
\
We just stare at the screen\
Not even wondering where the hell have we been\
Our Facebook page clearly reflects\
A player’s lifestyle, come place your bets\
\
Tell our mothers ...\
\
Yes, It’s the Art of the Deal\
Just tell me your last name, Amigo, as I swing for the kill\
The Man says: “you’re fired”, “get off my field”\
And on your way out\
Don't forget to pay for my book at the till\
\
Tell our mothers ...\
\
So incognito we stroll\
Where barely legal seductresses troll\
NSA’s got exit nodes and all\
Still we put our faith in the God of Tor\
\
Snowden and Julian are holding the torch\
Like cattle for slaughter, we’re grazed on the porch\
Who cares where’s the embassy, it’s boom now or bust\
Trump is our boy, let’s go burn a cross!\
\
Tell our mothers not to cry no more\
Peace and love songs done it all\
Tell our sisters not to fight no more\
Someone just posted an App for that on the Apple store\
\
Tell our brothers not to come back home\
Soon there’ll be a draft note by the door\
Go tell our father’s graves what you already know\
White man’s coming back for your soul
