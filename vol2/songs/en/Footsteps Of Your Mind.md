# Footsteps Of Your Mind
\
I can’t bring back the summer\
I can’t hug you from afar\
I can’t say that I’m hurting\
That you never crossed my mind\
\
For all those years I’ve been a-changing\
Waiting patiently in line\
For your memory to follow\
On the footsteps of your mind\
\
Slander and sallow, a chambermaid\
Waiting on tables, of moms and dads\
A midnight swimmer, she’s not afraid\
Of adulation, from kings of spades\
\
They enter slowly, fixing their gaze\
Sinking fingers into her maze\
“She's quite perplexing”, one of them says\
As he chafes his collar, he’s out of phase\
\
'Cause you've got no recall\
Know nothing at all\
You're about to fall ...\
Here comes the call:\
\
But I can’t bring back the summer\
I can’t hug you from afar\
I can’t say that I’m hurting\
That I never crossed your mind\
\
For all those years I’ve been a-changing\
Waiting patiently in line\
For your memory to follow\
On the footsteps of your mind\
\
Now it's all brand new\
\
Will you swallow, the torch and blade\
Or walk the shadows, feel the grains\
Of every picture, she’s ever mailed\
Soon you’re spinnin’, you're out of phase\
\
'Cause you've got no recall\
Know nothing at all\
You're about to fall ...\
Better make the call:\
\
'Cause you can’t bring back the summer\
You can’t hug her from afar\
You can’t say that you're sorry\
That she never crossed your mind\
\
For all those years you've been a-changing\
Waiting patiently in line\
For her emory to follow\
On the footsteps of her mind\
\
Now it's all brand new\
Shining, sparking blue (青い)\
