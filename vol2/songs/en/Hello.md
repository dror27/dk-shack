# Hello

When loving hits you hard\
It really gets you moving\
When lovin' hits you hard\
It sends you going\
\
From the place that everybody's calling home\
To the woman you've been loving all along\
Till someone picks the phone and says hello\
\
Hello,\
Do you miss me at all?\
Are you coming back?\
Or are you gone?\
\
Hello,\
Do you feel me at all?\
Can you hear me crying all along?\
Are you really never coming home?\
