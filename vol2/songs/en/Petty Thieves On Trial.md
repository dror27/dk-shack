# Petty Thieves On Trial

Guess it’s the weekend\
Kids have long left for school\
He’s making dinner\
Sets the table for two\
Lights up the candles\
Serves his face up for a kiss\
Sets an alarm for early morning\
Tomorrow’s trip a sign of peace \
\
Sings her a love song\
No one know who it is for\
As he wails, she moves around the room\
Always staring at the floor\
He says it’s heaven\
The way we ended up like this\
But his own mind's already tripping\
Gravity it sinks\
\
There’s something missing\
Even though we’re kissing hard\
I’ve got a feeling\
But it’s not love\
There ain't no ending\
No one’s coming bailing us out\
We’re just hanging here\
For a while \
Like petty thieves on trial\
\
Then there’s silence\
For a hundred miles or more\
You turn the radio on\
They’re still talking about the war\
Somehow she’s smiling\
Her eyes still nailed to the floor\
You’ve been gentle and pleasing\
But she's need of something more\
\
There’s something missing\
Even though we’re making out\
I’ve got a feeling\
But it’s not lust\
There ain't no ending\
No one’s coming bailing us out\
We’re just hanging here\
For a while \
Like petty thieves on trial\
\
Now comes the sentence\
You both face the judge of all\
Time - it is the great oppressor\
A libertarian of lost souls\
It’ll surely bail you out\
Scot-free you’ll be under a stone\
So you better unbuckle fast \
Lest your time soon will be gone\
\
There’s something missing\
Even though we’re playing house\
I’ve got a feeling\
But it’s not us\
There ain't no ending\
No one’s coming bailing us out\
We’re just hanging here\
For a while \
Like petty thieves on trial
