# Dreams

Can a guy my age get a woman to sing\
Harmonize in lock-step to the tales of his years\
In vegetarian pubs, dirty and clean\
Can a guy my age even sing?\
\
And if she would be willing to be so inclined\
To travel ‘round the world, make them dizzy in rhymes\
With smiles and kisses, put on display\
Can a guy my age even play?\
\
Can a guy even dream about a woman who sings\
Without running away from the girl of his dreams\
Can a guy even dream?\
\
Can a guy my age make promises he keeps\
Keep a straight face in public while he loses his teeth\
Show love and afection, be touched and be seen\
Can a guy my age be a thing?\
\
Can a guy even dream about a woman who sins\
Without loosing the girl, the girl of his dreams\
Can a guy even dream?\
\
Keep your dreams between the lines boy\
Keep your chord changes clean\
Harmonize with the truth\
Keep them guessing until\

There's nothing to wait for\
‘Till time disappears\
Oh, are you ready for fate\
To take over the wheel?\
\
Can a guy even dream about a woman who sings\
Without running away from the girl of his dreams\
Can a guy even dream?
