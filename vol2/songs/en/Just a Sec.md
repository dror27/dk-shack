# Just a Sec
\
Let me take just a sec\
To lay on the sofa, go over the facts\
Yes, we’re married, that’s true\
Still, there’s a whole lot of messin' we can do\
The sun is out, its warm, the sky’s blue\
How about it … just me and you?\
\
Let me take just a sec\
To walk you down memory lane, no regrets\
Your cotton dress got stained, the wine\
It made you walk and talk, in perfect rhymes\
Getting high on some lonesome lullaby\
On drunken cowboys in rhinestone shine\
\
Let me take just a sec\
To work it out, embellish the facts\
Every now and then, there comes a time\
When the sun shines on the fallen behind\
Finally today, I sort of lost my mind\
And found it laying next to you, in double time\
\
Let me take just a sec\
It has been so long since I was taken aback\
Yes, you got burly eyes\
The kind that flood a city block when they cry\
I want to make love to you, like we never met\
Make you breakfast, walk your pet\
\
Let me take just a sec\
To play this song, so you won’t forget\
Yes, some folk will call it wrong\
It’ll be in the public, before too long\
I might never be your one-and-all\
A perfect ending to this Cock and Bull\
\
Let me take just a sec\
To lay on the sofa, go over the facts\
Yes, we’re both married, that’s true\
Ain’t it my luck that I married to you?\
Guess, we’re not alone here too\
Cut the lights Hon, I’m coming through
