# Fall & Summer

She says: before we’re getting any further\
You have to tell me if we’re gonna fuck\
See, I was hanging on a tether\
Waiting on a friend is just too much\
\
When she says Fuck she doesn’t mean what you think\
That thing you do when you’re in love\
Someday you’ll die and roll in heaven\
Where you’d be eating from her glove\
\
See, in the spring you get your flowers\
In winter you got rain\
But fall and summer leave you wondering\
Will she even call again?\
\
Now before you all you go on dreaming\
About that thing that rhymes with luck\
Stare yourselves right in the mirror\
Are you hungry or just starstruck?\
\
For if your belly’s full of poems\
And mind is wide and lush\
She’ll call you cute and send you tokens\
But never meet you after dark\
\
See, in the spring you get your flowers\
In winter you got rain\
But fall and summer leave you wondering\
Will she even call again?\
\
Now I know you’ve got geometry on your mind\
I had math and blindfolds too\
The sweetest angels they’re the devil in disguise\
They’re never meant for me and you\
\
So head on home to your loved ones\
Change your number if you can\
Take a really long vacation\
Do your best to pretend\
\
See, in the spring you get your flowers\
In winter you got rain\
But fall and summer leave you wondering\
Will she even call again?
