# Mouse Loves a Cat

I loved you like a madman\
Running through a fire\
I loved you like a sailor\
Drenched in desire\
I loved you like the morning\
Rises up towards the sky\
Now I don’t anymore\
Please don’t ask me why\
\
You thought I would be there\
For you to hold on\
Forever, here on after\
‘Till we’re both dead and gone\
You cried at the right times, laughed at my jokes\
Now I come to think of us\
As one big hoax\
\
And there's nothing you can do\
What I’m saying is true\
Because ...\
I loved you like a flower that was almost fully grown\
Now summer has burned it\
And my love is gone\
\
Well, you did your best\
To get me out of cage\
Sent me love notes, dirty pictures\
Got my body engaged\
You even sent flowers\
To my wedding girl\
Well, If love was a pigeon\
I'm sure you'd send one my way\
\
But there ain’t nothing you can do\
What I’m saying is true\
Because ...\
You loved me like a catalog loves the pages it holds\
Never thinking that one day, I might actually be sold\
\
Well, I’ll be thinking of you probably every day\
Or just once a season when my mind’s astray\
When the wind picks the trash, that’s when I get weak\
If you’re feeling the same, please do not speak\
\
‘Cause there ain’t nothing we can do\
What I’m saying is god’s honest truth\
Our love was like the love between a mouse and a cat\
But a cat, it loves no one, for it’s just a cat\
