# My House On The Moor

Of things I’ve started \
All but one will abend \
The rest are still racing \
Ignorant of their end \
\
Wayside they fall, lovers and hopes \
To a tale they once told \
Now they’re merely spectators \
of sorts \
\
To a future so lucid \
It’s a bet not to be missed \
Now the horses have fled \
With a kiss of their lips \
\
The cheerleaders cheered \
The choir it snored \
As I strolled to the finish \
With a pint of a Guinness \
To my house on the moor \
\
The dogs kept on barking \
As the convoy pushed on \
To the next pub in town \
Where bound to be found \
With a smile and a song\
\
So As I exit the room \
Where the stage has been set \
For a play of lifelong promises \
Some call it: success \
\
I’m a host to all things \
That will fail to no end \
Being happily blind \
To the one to sustain \
\
To a future so lucid \
It’s a bet not to be missed \
Now the horses have fled \
With a kiss of their lips \
\
The cheerleaders cheered \
The choir it snored \
As I strolled to the finish \
With a pint of a Guinness \
To my house on the moor \
\
The dogs kept on barking \
As the convoy pushed on \
To the next pub in town \
Where bound to be found \
With a smile and a song
