Morning, twenty fifth\
Up early, mind adrift\
“The Wanting Comes In Waves”\
Jaffa Cakes, Coffee, GIFs\
\
A world dark asleep\
Dreaming for its keep\
Phones ahead charging sync\
Percentage points, emojis, tricks\
\
What an affair this is\
A babe of five weeks\
Years lay ahead\
Here, seconds tick\
\
In wanting, in flight\
We both partake delight\
The colder the water\
The joyful the conquest, the fright\
