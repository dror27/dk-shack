Eventually, we’ll have to cover spanking as a form of punishment, as a tool for correcting behaviour. Popularised in schools, mostly in the lower grades, it ranged from a cautionary slapping on the hand to full on caning.
 
One has to reach deep to try and come up with a narrative that positively encompasses this practice and the pleasurable use of spanking during an act of making love. Don’t expect to receive much in the way of understanding here. When all fails, ask for a hug.
