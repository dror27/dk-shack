When young, one spanks as if buffeting a widely unruly creature into submission. Eventually, the pounding stops, the shooting from side to side disappears and the wound is finally healed. 

The subconscious has a strange way of nipping you in the butt. Check your surroundings. Keep calm. Blow your cover. Fold back your defences. You’re in for a hug.
