The ideal spank, he muttered, nervous at her directness, would pound me thin, stroke me mercilessly, make me scream, come with cream. If I should be so keen, please, please, Ma’am, please be mean. 

Yep, he is one of those, she recoiled, coming in all strong, and then, in a fit of paroxysm, collapses onto my boots, crying. I’d need my smelling salts and Mayan spells to get him back on his feet. He’s just one big drama queen looking for a stage, eager for a scene. Best I just stand in the wings, hover like the queening bee that I am. A hug, a sting, a hug, a sting. Forget me not, you little thing.
