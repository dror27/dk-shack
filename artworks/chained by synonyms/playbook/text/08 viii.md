When spanking a loved one, try not to hammer home every stroke. Allow some flapping and be sure to move around, lest you entice any blebs and bruises. Keep tabs on your loved one’s breathing patterns. Watch for signs of fatigue. Do it well, second guess not, prize and praise. 

When spanking a loved one, treasure the moment, and end with a hug. When spanking a not-loved one, don’t spank.
