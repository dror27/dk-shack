In peopleâ€™s minds, we spank to diminish, to take down, to devour the meek. But we are sinners in love, ducking bullets, snipers above. Bury me under the weeping willow tree, for I rather drown than be silent for my keep.

Merged at the hip, clinching ever so present, we hug as two stupid cheap tricks.
