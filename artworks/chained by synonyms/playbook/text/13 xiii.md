### /spank/set down/engrave/flag/wear out/obsess/take up/hold/hug/

The art of spanking is not set down in stone, nor is it engraved in any canonical text or pasted in colourful stripes across a well recognised flag. Such stringencies all wear out eventually, or so Iâ€™m told.

Obsess not. Take up the space you require. Hold on tight. Hug in spite.
