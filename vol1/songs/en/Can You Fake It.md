# Can You Fake It?

I hope you’re sleeping\
With the boy who dumped you, when you were stoned\
Don’t you find it creepy\
That he still loves you, after all\
Now that you’re filthy-\
Rich and famous, you’re the doll\
But can you really fake it?\
\
The pleasant life, the girls next door\
The backyard chitchat about wooden floors\
The second mortgage for a brand new Ford\
\
Can you really fake it?\
When he calls you honey, at the store\
While shopping for bullets\
For the gun, he neatly stores\
Underneath a mattress\
In your own bedroom, now you both know\
Oh, but can you fake it?\
\
The pleasant life, the girls next door
The backyard chitchat about wooden floors\
The second mortgage for a brand new\
Ford The fucked-up prenup with a backdoor clause\
The teenaged son he so adores\
The perfect weather, oh, what a bore\
Can you fake it?\
\        
I hope you’re happy\
I wrote these verse, once before\
When you came running\
Into my arms, straight from a war\
I gave you shelter\
But you turned hot, you wanted more\
I guess you couldn’t fake it\
\
The pleasant life, the girls next door\
The backyard chitchat about wooden floors\
The second mortgage for a brand new Ford\
The fucked up prenup with a backdoor clause\
The teenaged son I so adore\
The perfect weather, oh, what a bore\
The babydoll you never wore\
The ball and chains made out of gold\
I guess you couldn’t fake it\
