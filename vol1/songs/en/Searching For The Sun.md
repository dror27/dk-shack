# Searching For The Sun

It's getting late\
Oh, but not too late\
To fall in love\
To lose it all, to forget\
Your sense of self\
Your memories, regrets\
Are welcomed here\
Just come on near\
\
Your very best\
Has yet to come, just get undressed\
Put on your catsuit\
Hit the streets, you know the rest\
Will follow on without a plan\
You see\
The world’s at your command\
It understands\
\
That when you’re searching for the sun\
Every trick you pull is like a gun\
When you know the race has run\
The only one left standing is your son\
He’s the one
\       
All the joy\
Every moment that you had\
Has taught the boy\
Things he will never learn on TED\
To light a fire\
Crack some wood\
Fix some shelter, cook some food\
To know he’s good\
\
‘Cause when you’re searching for the sun\
Every trick you pull is like a gun\
When you know the race has run\
The only one left standing is your son\
He’s the one\
\
Sober or drunk dead\
Sane or crazy in the head\
Never be afraid\
To sing his song\
To tell his praise\
To be amazed
