# Climaxing

I once knew a bloke\
He'd never be late\
To his dental appointment\
He barely could wait\
\
To his master at large\
He would wait by the gate\
When his chains were removed\
He screamed: "Oh no, my poor fate!"\
\
I once knew a woman\
Who could never quite stall\
She'd always rush in\
Expecting to fall\
\
When her spirit was high\
She seemed to be small\
When her chains were removed\
She cried: "Oh no, I want back my soul!"\
\
The two of them met\
As agreed, sharply at eight\
At a bar, down the corner\
On Charles Ave. and Tate\
\
No one knows the hows and whys\
But they both passed on cake, low fat\
They climaxed together, of course\
Exactly as planned, with chains or without, I now forget\
