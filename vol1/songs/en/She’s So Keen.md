# Sheâ€™s So Keen

She's got serpents running down her thigh\
For you to chase like a beast\
On your knees you will drop as you cry\
While she continues to feast\
\
On your emotions she will dance as you choke\
You're a sight to be seen\
The world is watching as she rocks on the boat\
With her favorite sin\
\
She's so keen, like a mean machine\
And she'll never stop, or let the ball get dropped\
Until she wins\
\
One of these days she's gonna light up a fire\
Burn your clothes to the ground\
From the ashes she will spell out D-E-S-I-R-E\
Drag you all over town\
\
Your throbbing lust in the streets she will ride\
Like in a July parade\
Until you reach for her heart in a fight\
Against your moral decay\
\
She's so keen, like a mean machine\
And she'll never stop, or let the ball get dropped\
Until she wins
