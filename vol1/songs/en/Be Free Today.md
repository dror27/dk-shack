# Be Free Today

She goes out hunting, for most of the night\
The streets are empty, no soul is in sight\
She whispers softly: "I'm losing this fight\
My body is yearning, but my soul is in flight"\
\
Oh my, the spell is gone\
You're feeling all alone and pushed away\
It’s time for you to run away, be free today\
\
Oh my, your knees are weak\
Your stomach feels sick and your head plays games\
Run away, be free today\
\
Whenever the phone rings, she let out a sigh\
It’s one of those moments for saying goodbye\
You know it’s never easy, being pretty and kind\
They always want you, but you never know why\
\
Oh my, the spell is gone\
You're feeling all alone and pushed away\
It’s time for you to run away, be free today\
\
Oh my, your knees are weak\
Your stomach feels sick and your head plays games\
Run away, be free today
