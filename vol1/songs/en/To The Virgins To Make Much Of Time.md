# To The Virgins To Make Much Of Time

(lyrics: Robert Herrick)\
\
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,\
Old Time is still a-flying:\
And this same flower that smiles to-day\
To-morrow will be dying.\
\
Then be not coy, but use your time,\
And while ye may, go marry:\
For having lost but once your prime,\
You may for ever tarry.\
\
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\
The higher he 's a-getting,\
The sooner will his race be run,\
And nearer he 's to setting.\
\
Then be not coy, but use your time,\
And while ye may, go marry:\
For having lost but once your prime,\
You may for ever tarry.\
\
That age is best which is the first,\
When youth and blood are warmer;\
But being spent, the worse, and worst\
Times still succeed the former.\
\
Then be not coy, but use your time,\
And while ye may, go marry:\
For having lost but once your prime,\
You may for ever tarry.
