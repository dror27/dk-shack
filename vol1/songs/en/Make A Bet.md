# Make A Bet

It started off one day\
When you decided to be gay\
You packed your bag and left the town\
Headed for the bay\
Where all the people flock\
They work around the clock\
Selling posters and candy in the park\
\
Then you decided to be rich\
Found a story you could pitch\
To a room full of grumpy old men\
And some ladies dressed in pink\
When everyone smiled\
You knew it’s time to run and hide\
‘Cause it’s just another silly pie in the sky\
\
So get your story straight\
On what you are and what you ain’t\
Before it gets too late\
Your time is up, don’t hesitate\
\
Your future hasn’t happened yet\
So stop the searching and create\
Make some love and meditate\
Roll your own dice, make a bet\
\
‘Cause life is like a big roulette\
You never know what you can get\
If you keep copying others\
Your future’s already set\
How to tell right from wrong?\
What’s your style and what’s your song?\
Where’s your home, where do you belong?\
\
So get your story straight\
On what you are and what you ain’t\
Before it gets too late\
Your time is up, don’t hesitate\

Your future hasn’t happened yet\
So stop the searching and create\
Make some love and meditate\
Roll your own dice, make a bet
