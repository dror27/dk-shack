# Bound For Glory

Well, you made it in school\
Play guitar, you’re so cool\
Made a small fortune\
Now step it up, make the news\
\
Be someone who cares,\
About pollution, clean air\
Be the new Messiah\
At least for a day\
\
Hey mister, can’t you tell\
There ain’t no heaven, no hell\
Hey mister, can’t you see\
I was bound for glory, but now I’m free\

Free from my brothers in arms\
From whatever I should have become\
Free from being the President\
Of the whole wide world\
\
Free from bullies in school\
From being awkwardly ruled\
By religion, conflicted & cruel\
Do you take me for a fool?\
\
Hey mister, can’t you tell\
There ain’t no heaven, no hell\
Hey mister, can’t you see\
I was bound for glory, but now I’m free\
\
But God is waiting for you\
He’s got the real job too\
To take out all evil\
And instill some fear\
\
So listen closely, you prick\
I got me a copy of your hard disk\
So you better, explode\
Or else your mom will get sick\
\
Hey mister, can’t you tell\
There ain’t no heaven, no hell\
Hey mister, can’t you see\
I was bound for glory, but now I’m free
