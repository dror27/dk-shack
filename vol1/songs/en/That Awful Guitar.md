# That Awful Guitar

A few years back, when I was just a boy\
I fell in love with a six string, I believe it was a toy\
It sounded, oh, like shit, but I cried then: “Ahoy”\
First girl I played it for, her name was Eva Troy\
She said ...\
\
Take that awful guitar and shove it down the drain\
It buzzes like a chainsaw, It’s driving me insane\
Spend a few more bucks and get some deep sustain\
Take that awful guitar and shove it down the drain\
\
I made my way up, to a fancy store downtown\
Showed the man some action, put my money down\
Asked for a real nice blond, that wouldn’t run around\
Played her to my folks, well, she made an awful sound\
They said ...\
\
Take that awful guitar and shove it down the drain\
It buzzes like a chainsaw, It’s driving us insane\
Spend a few more bucks and get some deep sustain\
Take that awful guitar and shove it down the drain\
\
I bought my second home, had a few bright kids\
Wrote a ton of songs, some with fancy frills\
Fell in love six times, gave the world a chill\
But after every show, well, the same line I would hear:\
It goes ...\
\        
Take that awful guitar and shove it down the drain\
It buzzes like a chainsaw, It’s driving us insane\
Spend a few more bucks and get some deep sustain\
Take that awful guitar and shove it down the drain\
\
The moral of the story, to you I will now tell\
There’ll always be a better one, someone is out to sell\
But you can point them to the door, or send them back to hell\
That’s where they belong, down the land of show and tell\
Tell them ...\
\
Take your fancy guitar and shove it down the drain\
Mine buzzes like a chainsaw, but I like it just the same\
Spend a few more bucks, and get some deep sustain\
But you can take your fancy guitar and shove it down the drain\
‘Cause I like my buzzing guitar just the same!
