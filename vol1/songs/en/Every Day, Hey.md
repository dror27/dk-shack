# Every Day, Hey

Every day I get down on my knees, and pray\
For you to grant me pardon, for a stay\
The chopping block is getting colder, so if I may\
Put on your dancing shoes, we’re going out today\
\
‘Cause every day is just another day (hey)\
A day you might be leaving or back to stay\
Everyday is just another day (hey)\
A day I might be headed down your way\
\
Every day I count my blessings, and I say\
How about you and me, roll out in the hay\
Still nursing bullet holes, from yesterday\
Are you still carrying that pepper spray?\
\
‘Cause every day is just another day (hey)\
A day you might be leaving or back to stay\
Everyday is just another day (hey)\
A day I might be headed down your way\
\
There are certain things I’d like to do, not say\
Out on the road with you, and then I’ll play\
And sing about eternal love, that’s here to stay\
But in the meantime, I’ll go swimming in the bay\
\
‘Cause every day is just another day (hey)\
A day you might be leaving or back to stay\
Everyday is just another day (hey)\
A day I might be headed down your way
