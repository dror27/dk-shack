# Calling You Home

Since you've been away from home\
The grass has grown, the yard is gone\
Silhouettes, they roam your dreams\
Serial killers, magazines\
And in their minds, they put you down\
Like it's a scene on some flat screen\
\
Is there something calling you to get back home?\
A voice you hear at night on the telephone?\
Is there something calling you to get back home?\
Calling you, when you're alone:\
“Get Back Home”\
\
People think you're some machine\
Grinding out plans and schemes\
Hoping one day to succeed\
In wiping out memories\
While you keep paying all the bills\
Living large, ever teen\
\
Is there something calling you to get back home?\
A voice you hear at night on the telephone?\
Is there something calling you to get back home?\
Calling you, when you're alone:\
“Get Back Home”
