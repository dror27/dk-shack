# Guidelines For Getting My Attention

Here we go again\
You’re calling me from plant Pain\
Telling me: you see -\
I just found the time\
Between the kids and a rhyme\
To talk to you for a sec\
\
You see I’m not as pretty as before\
But I’m sure you remember what you came here for\
It’s still there, under the housewife shield\
I still turn some heads up on the hill\
Are you still into being my pet?\
\
Go play with a hose\
Stick some matches under the stove\
Go get your smile all polished up\
And maybe then I’ll crack you up\
\
Yes it’s true that I wanted you\
Right there from the start\
But you had your reasons\
For keeping your heart shut\
\
So go play with a hose\
Stick some matches under the stove\
Go get your smile all polished up\
And maybe then I’ll crack you up\
\
You had your chance right there\
You laughed it off, like you didn’t care\
But now you’re calling, you want it back\
Well ... how about that ...\
\
How about we peel off the mask\
Play a little game now\
A game I call\
“Risking Your Lust”\
\
Say what you want\
Before you are clear\
Of the response you’ll be getting\
Can you do this for me, my dear?\
\
Or go play with a hose\
Stick some matches under the stove\
Go get your smile all polished up\
And maybe then I’ll crack you up
