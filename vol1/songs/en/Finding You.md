# Finding You

I can see\
Finding you will take time, so I’d better\
And my mom\
Well, she’s not gonna live forever\
\
I can hear all the voices, they’re calling for me\
But it's me that is hearing, they’re silent memories\
\
I can feel\
That you can feel, that I’m not all together\
On the floor\
As you’re sweeping away all my feathers\
\
I can hear all the voices, they’re calling for me\
But it's me that is hearing, they’re silent memories\
\
Memories that come and go\
Ever since I let you go\
Memories that come and go\
\
I can see\
finding peace will take time, but not forever\
If we can be\
All alone and be quiet, together\
\
I can hear all the voices, they’re calling for me\
But it's me that is hearing, they’re silent memories
