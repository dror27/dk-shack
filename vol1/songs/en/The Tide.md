# The Tide

Sit tight, upright\
As darkness overtakes the light\
Your back against the wall\
\
And as you wait, anticipate\
Scan your past and contemplate\
You're on your own again\
\
You took yourself for being strong\
You learned to play and sing a song\
But now you're overcome by fear\
Of losing all that you held dear\
\
The cost seems reasonably unfair\
You're almost crazy just to dare\
But yet you swallow back your pride\
And fix your boat up for the tide
