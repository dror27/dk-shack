# Boredom Is Indeed A Chore

So holy, so lonely\
From her bosom down to her feet\
Comes summer’s harvest, in the fields\
She’s let it all rip\
\
So tall, to fall\
Bronze lips, melted cheeks\
Kisses fierce as sea pirates\
Eyes sharp as ice picks\
\
Oh, boredom is indeed a chore\
Always wanting more and more\
Pour me some whiskey, to soothe out my plight\
Dreams come play catch-up, in my head, tonight\
\
Out of tune guitar\
She’ll never be a star\
Harmonizing, more like colliding\
With the engine of my car\
\
Not a single word I get\
She must be in a trance\
Dare I put one finger in\
I’m sure she’ll do the rest
\
Oh, boredom is indeed a chore\
Always wanting more and more\
Pour me some whiskey, to soothe out my plight\
Dreams come play catch-up, in my head, tonight 

There’s no telling what’s in store\
Once you open up the door\
There are morals left to fight\
Once you turn on the light\
\
‘Cause, boredom is indeed a chore\
Always wanting more and more\
Pour me some whiskey, to soothe out my plight\
Dreams come play catch-up, in my head, tonight
