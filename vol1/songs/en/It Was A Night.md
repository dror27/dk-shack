# It Was A Night

It was a night, a perfect night\
And I was looking for you\
Did not know who you were, or what you looked like\
But I was wanting you\
\
It was a night, a perfect night\
And I was feeling you\
It's been a while, we’ve grown apart\
I guess you felt that too\
\
It was a night, the best of nights\
And I was dreaming too\
I could not tell my left from my right\
Wherever I looked, I saw you\
\
It was a night, a perfect night\
And I was playing the fool\
It’s been some time, we messed around\
I guess you’ve been there too\
\
It was a night, our very last night\
And I was fleeting too\
I saw you running, tights and all\
Were you as scared as I was too?\
\
It was a night, a perfect night\
We had it all, but lost\
A game is played but once, not twice\
I guess you knew that too\
