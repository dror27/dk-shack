# Pretend

When I was just shy of seventeen\
The days were short, the nights were kings\
We stayed awake to sing a song\
We never thought we could do wrong\
That's when I found lust\
\
In the back room of a store
Our bodies pressed onto the floor\
Until we lost all sense of time\
That's when you told me you were mine\
That's when I found out\
\
Now I’m waking from a dream\
Where I keep asking you've been\
I wrote a letter to you:\
"My lovely girl, why have you been untrue?"\
\
You're bursting at the seams\
Tripping over our best dreams\
I'm warning you\
But my mind's already set\
So I pretend\
\
Then I became twenty-one\
I flew a plane, I held a gun\
I met a girl, oh so sweet\
She took my love and went to sleep\
That's when I found pain\
\
In the back of a magazine\
In moving pictures on a screen\
I've built a world so long and wide\
When she'd call, that's where I'd hide\
That's when I found love\
\
It's a story about a man\
Trying to do the best he can\
Every now and then\
He understands the meaning of his life\
\
Locked up in some bedroom\
See him howling at the moon\
He's warning you\
But his own mind's already set\
So he pretends\
\
Now most folks think it’s a sin\
To live alone, not to be seen\
To steal away the time\
To never ask nobody for a dime\
\
I'm happy to recede\
Not ever to succeed\
I'm warning you\
'Cause my mind's already set\
I won't pretend
