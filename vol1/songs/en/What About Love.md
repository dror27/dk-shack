# What About Love

The old are getting older\
Young ones getting younger\
The bold are getting bolder\
The soft are getting softer\
Like cotton balls in Q-Tip holders\
\
The rich are getting richer\
The punched are getting punchier\
The beats are getting better\
Hi-hats flying higher\
Much higher than a dove\
\
But what about the love?\
Is it getting higher, softer\
Louder, better\
Younger or richer?\
Or is it getting older?\
\
When a love becomes a lover\
Who gently taps you on the shoulder\
Then cold lips turn to another\
Warmth of bodies turns a-blunder\
\
But what about the love?\
Is it getting higher, softer\
Louder, better\
Younger or richer?\
Or is it getting older?\
\
Forever and ever is never over\
Says the preacher, born in Dover\
God is fighting couples turning over\
By keeping tabs under the covers\
\
But what about the love?\
Is it getting higher, softer\
Louder, better\
Younger or richer?\
Or is it getting older?
