# Being Yourself

You think your love is something so unique\
That you can gather all the pieces as you leave\
Spice them and up and serve them on the side\
While you, the main dish, never have to slide\
\
You think that happiness is dumbfounded and blind\
Down at the corner it is paddling up for dimes\
You think you're kingpin of all that is fine\
A masterpiece in making, a tantalizing prime\
\
Still you're chilled by the sound of a young baby crying\
You're fearful of storms and of the moon rising\
So basic your failure to stand, on your own\
\
To learn how to walk with no shoes without whining\
To stand in the wind with no coat and be smiling\
To feel young and whole, for simply being yourself\
\
So with all false force you muster up your pride\
Exposing teeth where kissing lips abide\
Revenging demolitions brought up by the cure\
Investing all your time in figments so obscure\
\
Still you're chilled by the sound of a young baby crying\
You're fearful of storms and of the moon rising\
So basic your failure to stand, on your own\
\
To learn how to walk with no shoes without whining\
To stand in the wind with no coat and be smiling\
To feel young and whole, for simply, being yourself\
\
Warm voices are calling your home\
Your dad keeps on dialing, so pick up the phone\
Still your pain keeps on echoing strong, like a drone\
\
The charge in your fists it is real, you believe\
To wipe out the deeds with a blow, you conceive\
Still your fear keeps you locked up and chilled, all alone\
\
Maybe one day you'll wake up in a storm\
Your baby’s crying, your wife is not at home\
Your bare feet stepping on a wooden floor\
Will spell you forgiveness to your very own\
\
Then you won't be so chilled by the sound of the crying\
You won't be so fearful of storms and moon rising\
You'll be on your own, and still, you’ll feel warm\
\
You'll walk with no shoes alone with your darling\
You'll stand in the wind with no coat and be smiling\
And you will feel young and whole, for simply Being yourself
