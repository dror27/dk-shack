# Artisan Cobalt Dream

First you take that shovel\
Put it to the ground\
Dig deep boy, deeper still\
Until you hear that clanking sound\

Get that ore into the sack\
Bring it back to your commanding chief\
For every pound of Cobalt dug\
He’d give a few more grams to sniff\
\
Then up your nose and back again\
For the next sack to be filled\
It takes a hundred trips or more\
To get a single battery built\
\
Commanding chief will push it on\
Till it reaches Chinese shores\
To a working camp for the poor\
Sweating hours on the floor\
\
They’ll form and mold it to the specs\
Of a gayish Californian cat\
Stick it inside an alumni case\
Sanitize it from their breath\
\
The breath they have now not for long\
As lungs become all crammed for space\
From chemicals of bond and gloss\
Magnificent devices they do make  
\        
Then on the stage will come a god\
For an audience of a thousand cheers\
All neatly dressed and Ion rich\
Their bellies full of sprouts and beer\
\
“Supply control, humane approach”\
Is the slogan that they will reveal\
While gazing blankly at the men\
Seas and borders attempting still\
\
A longer life, a faster fill\
The battery of the future’s here\
Indeed a life of fun and thrills\
And cheap supply of human will\
\
And here I’m writing this\
On such a fine machine\
While being unplugged for days\
An Artisan Cobalt Dream\
\
A longer life, a faster fill\
The battery of the future’s here\
Indeed a life of fun and thrills\
And cheap supply of human will
