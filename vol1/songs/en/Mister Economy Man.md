# Mister Economy Man

Pretty hair-do, classy car\
Table waiting in every bar\
People treat you like a star\
While your ambitions hills they scar\
\
Lanes as rivers made of tar\
Red-white necklace, headlights of cars\
Smoke stacks ghastly, near and far\
Every day you raise the bar\
\
Hey mister economy man\
Come close, let me give you a hand\
Help you better understand\
The shallow land on which you stand\
\
You sit here telling me about all of your might\
How every man should be as bright\
How every woman should never lose sight\
Of her potential to solve all plight\
\
But all this energy, wits and skill\
You point to making toys that kill\
To listen and bug a common man’s meal\
Do you ever think how it feels?\
\
Hey mister economy man\
Come close, let me give you a hand\
Help you better understand\
The shallow land on which you stand\
\        
Someday you’ll understand\
Your own actions, you won’t pretend\
Ask forgiveness while you can\
Before mortality marks your end\
\
‘Cause the longer you wait, asking why\
The harder the blow, the louder the cry\
On your judgement, your day of trial\
While your own horrors project to the sky\
\
Hey mister economy man\
Come close, let me give you a hand\
Help you better understand\
The shallow land on which you stand\
\
Now that I scolded you well\
It may be time for me to tell\
I’m an economy man as well\
I plot and scheme for a wishing well\
\
Where I can ask for anything\
Big boats, airplanes, babes on swings\
Peace and love, fresh water streams\
Yes, I admit, I got me some dreams\
\
Hey mister economy man
Come close, let me give you a hand\
Help you better understand\
The shallow land on which you stand
