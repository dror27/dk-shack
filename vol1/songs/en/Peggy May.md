# Peggy May

Oh, where have you been Peggy May?\
Who did you screw for tips today?\
Did you wind up in a car?\
Or did you really touch the stars?\
\
Way back when you were just a child\
Your tantrums threw you to the side\
Picking pieces off the floor\
Never asking for some more\
\
And here you are, back at the door\
\
Collecting favors from your folks\
There’s really nothing left for talk\
“Just give me cash, and I’ll be out\
The neighbors watching, I’ll won’t shout”\
\
With cash, your conscious seems so clear\
losing all sense of pain and fear\
You choose your victim so swiftly\
“Come-on mister, wanna bite me?”\
\
Collecting favors from your folks\
There’s really nothing left for talk\
“Just give me cash, and I’ll be out\
The neighbors watching, I’ll won’t shout”\
\
But when they sweep the streets clean\
With their big white cleansing machines\
Will they show you mercy\
Or will they be so keen?\
On sweeping you out\
Along with their sins?\
\
So Peggy May, if I hereby may\
Do you right for just a single day\
For you indeed robbed me poor\
And dragged me through mud and gore\
\
But I still love you, Peggy May\
And for your soul at night I pray\
To be redeemed out of the curse\
For your mind to be nursed\
\
Still you’re collecting favors from your folks\
There’s really nothing left for talk\
“Just give me cash, and I’ll be out\
The neighbors watching, I’ll won’t shout"
