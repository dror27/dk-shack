# Ever So Slow

Ever since you’ve been a child\
You took upon yourself\
To try and make it easy\
For everybody else\

Kept your grandma company\
Your angry mother too\
Never letting off your guard\
Afraid of what she’ll do\
\
Your father, though a scholar man\
Was never strong enough\
You bit your lips and took it hard\
The beating made you tough\
\
But ever so slow\
I watched your spirit grow\
From the wonder child, the prodigy\
To the woman that I know\
\
Your journey was long\
And no one came along\
But here I am, take me in\
I’m knocking at your door\
\
Won’t you open up\
I’m coming in alone\
Don’t you realize\
It’s time for you to go\
\
You took a husband, you married young\
You ran away from home\
You had a child, he made you cry\
Then your daughter came along\
\
Another child, a bigger house\
But darling, where were you?\
Never asking to be loved\
As if you didn’t knew\
\
What it tastes to be kissed\
What’s the smell of love\
You thought your life was set in stone\
As if sent from above\
\
But ever so slow\
I watched your spirit grow\
From the wonder child, the prodigy\
To the woman that I know\
\
Your journey was long\
And no one came along\
But here I am, take me in\
I’m knocking at your door\
\
Won’t you open up\
I’m coming in alone\
Don’t you realize\
It’s time for you to go\
