# Goodbye

I’ve been called unlucky\
I’ve been called a fool\
I’ve been called lonesome\
And I’ve been crying for you\
\
I’ve been called chase-man\
And hangman, from the roof\
‘Cause I’ve been looking out for someone\
Who looks quite like you\
\
Ain’t it true, when people call me a fool\
Ain’t it true, ‘cause I’ve been out on a search, for you\
I’ve been spending my life and dime\
Around these parts of town\
\
I’ve been called shameless\
For running ‘round at night\
I’ve been called breathless\
For screaming out: “You’re Mine!”\
\
I’ve been cold, away from home\
And sleeping on the floor\
Yes, I’ve been called many names\
But I ain’t seen your name before\
\
This town got the best of us\
Or so I’m told\
This time I’m gonna run\
Lest the story of our love be old\
\        
But now I’m growing tired\
Of running around\
I’ve seen the best of friends go by\
They were hunted down\
\
I have no wish to complain\
This town gave me no sunshine and rain\
After all\
All I got was pain\
\
So it's goodbye my loved ones\
Something will remain\
Perhaps this song, or something else\
It won’t be the same\
\
Nothing will transpire\
From the all the mounds I’ve seen\
Nothing but a liar\
And a pants chaser through the years
