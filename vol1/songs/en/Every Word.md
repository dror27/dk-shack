# Every Word

Every word you say turns away\
Every sound you make makes you ache\
Every flower that you send will one day decay\
Every night you dread will one day be a day\
\
Every song you make will be a hit someday\
Every loss that’s on the books will be a gain someday\
Every face of sorrow will smile again someday\
‘Cause every word you say will change the world someday\
\
Every word you say\
Every sound you make\
Every flower that you send\
Every night you dread\
\
‘Cause every word you say can take away the pain\
Every song you make can open up the gates\
Every seed you plant will be a tree someday\
And every knife you break will be a pen someday\
\
Every song you play will touch someone today\
Every child you miss will come around today\
Every thought you think will come alive today\
‘Cause every word you say will change the world today
