# Right On

Right on!\
Carry the sign\
Let them know, they’d better be kind\
Don’t let go at all\
The night is yours to leave it all behind\
\
Hang on\
The sun is shining brighter than the clouds\
And if you live, you’d better leave a sign\
Lovers cry as birds fly high\
Leaving past regrets for bright tomorrows\
\
And tears are made for crying\
And stories left for lying\
Saying sorry doesn’t help\
Not at all\
\
It’s time\
To let it all hang out, to tell no lie\
The truth is big and brighter than the sky\
And if you can break out and try\
Soon you’ll rid yourself of pain and sorrow\
\
And tears are made for crying\
And stories left for lying\
Saying sorry doesn’t help\
Not at all\
