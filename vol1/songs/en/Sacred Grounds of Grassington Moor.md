# Sacred Grounds Of Grassington Moor

I walk the darkened mine shafts of Grassington Moor\
The Sacred Grounds\
For many lives here lost\
Nothing remains but the wind, it sounds:\
\
“Rubbly, frailing ghosts\
Chambers of death\
Gentle streams\
Thou layest old souls to rest”\
\
Black cows, white sheep\
Stones of lime\
Dotting grassy hills\
Far away a church bell chimes:\
\
"For men sunken below\
With pockets of lead\
Their wives crying a-gale\
Clutching babes they never had"\
\
Sacred Grounds\
Still, I walk\
In the distance\
Flies an RAF Hawk
