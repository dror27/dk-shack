# Coming Strong

When everything we say or do\
Makes no sense about me and you\
When every thing they say comes true\
I’m still coming back for you\
\
When every time we speak we fight\
When love and friendship seems to die\
When sleeping over makes you blue\
I’m still coming back for you\
\
You’re coming strong, when I’m alone\
My vision’s gone ‘cause you’re fading away\
I’m giving you just one more song\
Before I send you off, running away\
\
You’re making love just like a ghost\
So quit the party, I’m no host\
It’s time for you to pay the cost\
I’m still coming back for you\
\
I’m gonna make you understand\
I’m gonna take you by the hand\
My shadow you can not transcend\
I’m still coming back for you\
\
You’re coming strong, when I’m alone\
My vision’s gone ‘cause you’re fading away\
I’m giving you just one more song\
Before I send you off, running away\
\
‘Cause I’m not the one to care\
Or your sympathy to share\
‘Cause my disposition’s weak\
And that’s my power ...\
Being sick!\
\
You’re coming strong, when I’m alone\
My vision’s gone ‘cause you’re fading away\
I’m giving you just one more song\
Before I send you off, running away
