# Now Is The Time

Now is the time, to step out of line\
Spend your last dime, commit minor crimes\
Now is the time, let go of mankind, the world is fine\

“Fear comes out of thought” - So he says\
“The limits of matter are the ones that you dread”\
“Senseless desire, the cause of it all”\
“You are what you are, just because”\
\
Now is the time, to step out of line\
Spend your last dime, commit minor crimes\
Now is the time, let go of mankind, the world is fine\
\
Still you sit and complain, watch the news\
“She just called him a crook” - what a muse!\
Your guts are all swollen from stuffing inside\
The freedom you lack, the feelings you hide\
\
Now is the time, to step out of line\
Spend your last dime, commit minor crimes\
Now is the time, let go of mankind, the world is fine\
\
There’s nothing to do or to say
Politicians are agents of interest and pay\
The media’s all jaded, the network controlled\
Your tweets pathetic if nothing gets sold\
\
So now is the time, to step out of line\
Spend your last dime, commit minor crimes\
Now is the time, let go of mankind, the world is fine
