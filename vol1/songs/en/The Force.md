# The Force

When evening comes I'll wear your dress\
I'll sleep inside your silhouette\
Waiting for the morning to escape\
Your light of dark to take its place\
\
I'll slowly take your form and shape\
Your smile, your curls, your tenderness\
Until we two become the one\
And then again we split and run\
\
What is that force that tears apart\
The very thing it just helped to put up?\
Is it the fire in your eyes\
That kept me warm and is now burning my heart?\
\
Then morning comes around again\
We dance, we scream our love in pain\
And we care not if it is just\
'Cause we know soon it will be past\
\
What is that force that tears apart\
The very thing it just helped to put up?\
Is it the fire in your eyes\
That kept me warm and is now burning my heart?
