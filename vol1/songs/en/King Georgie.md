# King Georgie

George opened his eyes, saying: what is this place?\
Have I fallen dead, or is this outer space?\
People around here are talking about peace\
“Revolution’s over”, or something like this\
\
If something is wrong, fix it up in a song\
\
Georgie got up, said: where is my mom?\
I can’t seem to find her, I believe she’s all gone\
There’s nothing to eat, the house is a mess\
She left a note on the fridge: “I’m out getting ass”\
\
If something is wrong, fix it up in a song\
\
Now men will be boys, and girls shall be wives\
The Lord has a plan, for all suffering and strife\
Keep all women at bay, for if they be truly free\
Aggression of men be just a faint memory\
\
For the rule book has been written, by boys just like me\
With fear in their hearts, of being forgotten, out at sea\
\
For a woman of means, independent and able\
Would never keep a man as a horse in a stable\
She’d send him running free, for he can be such a pain\
There’s way too much loving, you know, to maintain\
\
If something is wrong, fix it up in a song\
\
Well, Georgie’s quite like you, at times he is dim\
But lately it’s been boring, being part of the scheme\
He thrown out the rule book, got nothing to hide\
A unique individual, still fighting the tide\
\
He’s doing the folk clubs, finger in ear\
The spark in his eyes all but quite disappeared\
But when out on the road, he’s the king of a stall\
At a rest stop in Texas, he’s running it all\
\
Oh ... if something is wrong, fix it up in a song\
Oh ... if something ain’t right, well, come see me tonight
