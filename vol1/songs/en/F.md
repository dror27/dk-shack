# F

I think I’m going insane\
Can’t seem to wash away\
The memory and the pain\
\
Is this the price to pay\
For dealing all my cards\
To hands that fade away?\
\
I’m turning grey\
Can’t seem to rise above\
Depression and decay\
\
Is this the only way\
To wait it out until it’s gone\
holding day by day?\
\
Forget, Forgive\
Fall in love and Fault no one\
Feel the truth and Fake it some\
Use some F words\
Stop being so polite\
\
And let there be light
