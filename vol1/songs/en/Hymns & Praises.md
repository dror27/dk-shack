# Hymns & Praises

Rays of sunshine trying hard to put a face\
Stormy clouds are holding tears close to the chest\
The wind howling muted, dark, without a sound\
We’re messing around\
\
Peeling clothes in secret places no one knows\
Riding shotgun in the backseat of a Ford\
Nature silent then, our kingdom to behold\
Now this is old\
\
Was it something that I said\
That has made you go away\
That has helped you cross the line\
Got you chasing ghosts and signs?\
\
Signs that tell you where to go and what to eat\
Ghosts from files named “X” and “Never to Delete!”\
You twist and turn at night before you go to sleep\
Oh, what a creep\
\
Was it something that I said\
That has made you go away\
That has helped you cross the line\
Got you chasing ghosts and signs?\
\
And now you’re talking\
In different tongues that I don’t understand\
And now you’re singing\
Hymns and praises of another man\
Who’s done you wrong\
\
Was it something that I said? ...
