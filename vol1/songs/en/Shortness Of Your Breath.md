# Shortness Of Your Breath
In the morning when you wake\
Suddenly, you think you made a big mistake\
Dancing all around the town\
Telling everyone your life has just began\
\
And now,\
The shortness of your breath is just a sign of your new weight\
And every passing day is a day filled with regrets\
And living seems so awkward, now that he's away\
So you close the door, trying to forget\
\
All the moments that you had\
The way he made you laugh when he grabbed your hand\
Threw you face-down on the bed\
Cutting all the lights\
To make you just a bit scared\
\
And now,\
The darkness truly seems like a lonely place to be\
And every hand that grabs you seems like some conspiracy\
You're face down on the bed, wearing naked misery\
While you're mind's all covered up, so you can't see\
\
How he beat you every night\
With words like “Stupid”, “Liar” and “A Dirty Slut”\
Chasing grace out of your life\
Cutting little pieces of your tender heart\
\
And now,\
Your blood runs freely down the column of your spine\
The love you had is gone, but darling you're still fine\
And you might find it shocking, but you are still alive\
Now's the time to turn the lights back on\
\
So in the morning when you wake\
Suddenly, you realize there's really no mistake\
In dancing all around the town\
Telling everyone your life has just began\
\
'Cause now\
The shortness of your breath\
Means you're climbing up the stairs\
And every passing day\
Is a day you won't regret\
\
And living seems to cool\
You almost hesitate\
To turn off the lights\
And fall into your bed
