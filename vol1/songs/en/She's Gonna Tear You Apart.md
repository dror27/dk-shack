# She's Gonna Tear You Apart

She's got plans and schemes\
Running through her mind\
She says: live and let live\
Never be too kind\
\
And you want her\
\
She's got beautiful friends\
To take her everywhere\
She keeps all their names\
Buried in her head\
\
Still you want her, you think you need her\
But ain't that a shame\
\
â€˜Cause she's gonna tear you apart\
She'll put a hole in your bleeding heart\
She'll make you a fool, for being so cruel\
\
She's got serious dreams\
But you're not in them, pal\
She's got everything\
Money ever buys\
\
Still you want her, you think you need her\
But ain't that a shame\
\
She's gonna tear you apart\
She'll put a hole in your bleeding heart\
She's make you a fool, for being so cool
