# Itâ€™s You

It's your life as it is\
Stop waiting to be born again\
It's your heart as it feels\
Stop wanting to be free again\
\
It's the life that you lead\
The smiles that you give\
Your bad breath in the morning\
And the things that you receive\
\
It's you\
That's true\
\
It's your age as you are\
Stop wanting to be young again\
It's your guts, the way it lusts\
Stop fucking with your mind again\
\
It's the colors that you wear\
The things that you dare\
Your bad breath in the morning\
And the things that you don't care for\
\
It's you\
It's true\
\
When it's coming right out loud\
That's what you are\
Come-on, level up
Let me show you what it's all about\
It's you\
That's true\
And it's gonna be alright\
When we go through\
\
It's the life that you lead\
The smiles that you give\
Your bad breath in the morning\
And the things that you receive\
\
It's you\
It's true\
\
It's your life as it is\
Stop waiting to be born again\
It's your heart as it feels\
Stop wanting to be free again\
\
It's your age as you are\
Stop wanting to be young again\
It's your guts, the way it lusts\
Stop fucking with your mind again
