# Rather Be Alone

I can be your lover, that’s true\
We'd have two beautiful kids, just me and you\
Sail across the seven seas, not a day feeling blue\
Yes, I can be your lover, that’s true
\
But I rather be alone, singing you this song\
Drifting, picking stones, weathering the storm\
Yes, I rather be alone, rolling on my own\
Flirting on the phone, watching soft porn\
\
Yes, I can be your special friend, no, I’ll never fret\
Listen to you nights on end, about a that boy that you just met\
Dare you from across the room, like an unlit cigarette\
Yes, I can be your special friend, the one you can’t forget\
\
But I rather be alone, singing you this song\
Drifting, picking stones, weathering the storm\
Yes, I rather be alone, rolling on my own\
Flirting on the phone, watching soft porn\
\
Yes, I can be a stranger to you, the one you’ll never meet\
We could be crossing paths, right now, on the very same street\
Standing quiet, side by side, staring down at our feet\
Yes, I can be a stranger to you, now that would be a feat\
\
But I rather be alone, singing you this song\
Drifting, picking stones, weathering the storm\
Yes, I rather be alone, rolling on my own\
Flirting on the phone, watching soft porn
