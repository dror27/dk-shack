# Tumbling Down

I'm drifting through the vastness of time\
To days when you were mine\
We're playing hide-and-seek beneath the vines\
Your hair as smooth as wine\
Your breast is as warm as summer fire\
But your eyes they tell a lie\
And I'm tumbling down the stairways of your mind\
\
You see I've been there before\
Where warm bodies, they make for time\
Where open arms and legs brings life\
To those who should be tired\
Where people that are bound to be free\
Are wedlock to retire\
And I'm tumbling down the stairways of your mind\
\
Now I'm overdosed by kindness\
Of a girl that's never mine\
Her body is a palace I serve\
Her gate is where I lie\
And when we're all alone, at night\
She's walking on a wire\
As she's tumbling down the stairways of her mind\
