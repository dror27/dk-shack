# Sending You Some Flowers

When I called you on the telephone\
Your buddy said you're not at home\
But I hear voices\
\
Are you cuddling down there, underneath?\
Your mouth is open for the kiss\
Now that it's over\
\
Now you're turning things around\
Sending me to lost and found\
Oh baby, what's the use?\
\
Of sending you some flowers\
Or counting down the hours\
Maybe it is time for us to say goodbye?\
\        
Do you still have just the slight recall\
For all the time and forked and stole\
When you were able\
\
Getting knocked out somewhere in a car\
Did it make you feel just like a star\
Or did you wonder?\
\
Why you're riding now on top\
Is it because I'm such a flop?\
Baby, what's the use?\
\
Of sending you some flowers\
Or counting down the hours\
Maybe it is time for us to say goodbye?\
\
So many things have come undone\
Your heart's been torn apart and spun\
You thought you were the only one\
It's time for you to see the sun\
\
Still, I’m sending you some flowers\
And I’m counting down the hours\
‘Cause maybe it ain’t time for us\
To say goodbye
