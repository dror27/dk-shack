# Angles Of The Dark

If I were a sailor\
I’d sail the highest seas and come for you\
On a ship of feathers\
I’d chart the ocean till I rescue you\
\
If I’ll have a doubt\
I’ll call the angels of the dark\
And if I’ll scream and shout\
I’ll pull you closer to my heart
\
If I were a horseman
I’d saddle up and ride into your arms\
Through fields of grief and sorrow\
I’d lift you from your pit of boiling tar\
\
If I’ll have a doubt\
I’ll call the angels of the dark\
And if I’ll scream and shout\
I’ll pull you closer to my heart\
\
If I were a fighter\
I’d put my hood and take my sword at hand\
For to bring you heaven\
I know I’d have to risk and face your man\
\
If I’ll have a doubt\
I’ll call the angels of the dark\
And if I’ll scream and shout\
I’ll pull you closer to my heart\
\
And if I were your savior\
On a ship, a horse, a hooded cloth\
Would you leave your castle?\
Your fortress, for my windy shores?\
\
If you’ll have a doubt\
Just call the angles of the dark\
And If you’ll scream and shout\
Just pull me closer to your heart\
\
And if we’ll have a doubt\
We’ll call the angles of the dark\
And If we’ll scream and shout\
We’ll pull each other, closer to our hearts
