# High Love

I got me a pair of lizards\
They’re climbing up my wall\
And every time I drift some\
They’re starting to unfold\

Sometimes I feel so old\
Like I’ve been tried and true\
I’m sick and tired of kissing\
I wanna run away from you\
\
And then you stare me in the eye\
Saying this is our goodbye\
Then we undress and drink the wine\
Your belly lusts but you ain’t mine\
\
And then you kick me out of bed\
I go and live right on the street\
And spend my time collecting\
New people that I meet\
\
And then you join me for the night\
We watch the couples kissing\
I feel your breasts and then you smile\
Is this high love or are we tripping?\
\
And then you kiss me on the cheek\
I smile and say that I love you\
And then we rush back to the streets\
The crowd’s our high love palace true\
