# Matters Of The Heart

As the body is getting old\
You’re surrounded by a foam\
People calling you at home\
Mostly working on the phone\
\
They won’t touch you with a stick\
Stare too much, they’ll call you a prick\
But your number they will pass\
Mark it up as: “still got some cash”\
\
Lonely, smart and prone to love\
I’ve been under and above\
I’ve been kissed and I’ve been struck\
Drawn forever on a lark\
Now that you are coming home\
I’m a stumbler, too far gone\
Awkward in so many ways\
Easy prey, in games you play\
\
‘Cause in matters of the heart\
I’ve been having some false starts\
So if I ask you for your hand\
or where we’re headed,\
\
Simply touch me, all of the way\
Don’t worry, I won’t stay\
It’s just a thing that I need today\
And probably every day 

‘Cause it’s always been my faith\
Touch someone, you’re good as death\
Everything you’ve ever known\
Will be taken, forever gone\
\
Yes, I’ve touched and I survived\
Lost it all and I’m alive\
No more a junky for the pain\
I want it missionary plain\
\
‘Cause in matters of the heart\
I’ve been having some false starts\
So if I ask you for your hand\
or where we’re headed,\
\
Simply touch me, all of the way\
Don’t worry, I won’t stay\
It’s just a thing that I need today\
And probably every day
