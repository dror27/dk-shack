# Cut The Life Support

You’re too afraid to live\
You’re too afraid to die\
People all around you\
They all take you for a ride\
You walk around naked\
But no one seems to care\
Your doctor says you’re healthy\
But that only made you scared\
\
‘Cause you forgot who you are\
Or how to touch and feel\
Cut the life support\
And let your body heal\
\
You’ve been to all the right schools\
Made top of every class\
The national statistics\
Say you’re going to be a blast\
You even made some money\
And screwed up on the side\
You thought that you’re invincible\
Your country’s song and pride\
\
But you’re so blind to love\
You don’t even know the drill\
Cut the life support\
And let your body heal\
\
But every now and then\
A thought creeps into your mind\
That you’re so full of it\
Nasty and unkind\
But then psychology\
Jumps right back to your aid\
‘Cause to suppress it all\
Is something so well praised\
\
So you sit back in your La-Z-Boy and say:\
\
“I am the Boss\
The ruler of this plot\
You people are my flock\
You’ll kiss me until you choke”\
\
But that’s just a joke\
\
That’s where the story takes a turn\
Not to the left nor to the right\
You gave it all your best\
And it did take all your might\
To stand out in the cold\
And shout your throat out loud\
But tell it to my face\
Did it really make you proud?\
\
And you still think like a bushman\
Waiting for the kill\
Cut the life support\
And let your body heal\
\
Now you’re 65 years old\
You don’t even have a home\
The life that you’ve led\
Has left you all alone\
Your teeth are now all gone\
And your pants are full of dust\
To walk into a hospital\
Most people say you must\
\
‘Cause you’re afraid to admit\
You’re way over the hill\
Cut the life support\
And let your body heal!
