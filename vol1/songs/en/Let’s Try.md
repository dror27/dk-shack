# Letâ€™s Try

The cat's in the yard\
The flowers in bloom\
The sunshine is out\
The boys in their rooms\
\
Can they tell where you've been last night?\
With their mother or sleeping outside?\
On the pavement where sleeping dogs lie?\
Let's try\
\
To imagine a world where truth is at hand\
Where forgive and forget is the law of the land\
Where the spirit of man is supreme\
Where language is king, not the scheme\
Where the young generation still knows how to dream\
\
Don't be shy, to ask me why\
Open your mind, come step inside\
And if you try, then you'll know why\
A man must walk alone sometimes\
\
Now they say that all roads lead to Rome\
But there're none\
Even rivers don't always flow downwards,\
My son\
\
Every person you meet is unique\
And what counts is your voice, not the street's\
So open the door\
It's time now for peace!\
\
Don't be shy, to ask me why\
Open your mind, come step inside\
And if you try, then you'll know why\
A man must walk alone sometimes\
