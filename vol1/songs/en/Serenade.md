# Serenade

Then something happened\
That never happened again\
He started walking\
And kept on walking till the end\
\
Then we were running\
We were running again\
Them people asking\
Where have you been, oh, my friend\
\
The serenade has left him\
He’s free to reign again\
Until he heard her calling\
He stopped and turned\
\
Then we were laughing\
About the times that we had\
Then we were singing\
The very song we just heard\
\
The serenade has left him\
He’s free to reign again\
Until he heard her calling\
He stopped and turned\
\
I will recall the years\
The laughter and the tears\
They’re coming back\
I will recall the years\
The marriage and the kids\
Until I’m dead\
