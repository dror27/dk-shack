# Running Away

Your sister, she’s heavy, she rides like the sun\
Flaming tattoos on every arm\
The tiles of her face, they look like a gun\
So isn't it surprising, you can’t feel no one\
\
She said she will marry to some rich man\
Who’ll give her everything that money ever names\
Now she rides on his horses straight into the dark\
One day she’ll find out what it’s all about\
\
It’s like being alone, alone in the dark\
It’s like running away, away from your past\
It’s like running away, away from a dart\
\
One day she remembered, how it used to be\
She would ride on his horses straight into the sea\
She would climb on his mountain, reach for his gold\
Swallow him whole, like he was a frog\
\
It’s like being alone, alone in the dark\
It’s like running away, away from your past\
It’s like running away, away from a dart\
\
That’s just the way things here get done\
By running around, by selling your crown\
You think that you’re riding on top, but you are\
Just chasing a dream, breathless and scarred\
\        
Oh, isn’t it a pity, that people are afraid\
Of the very thing they’re supposed to be\
\
Still, sometimes she recalls all the moments they had\
When he held her in his arms and whispered instead\
Saying: “Please dear, won’t you listen to me\
I got nothing to say but my heart it is free”\
\
It’s like being alone, alone in the dark\
It’s like running away, away from your past\
It’s like running away, away from a dart\
\
The story continued, for many long years\
They’d been riding along, way up on the hills\
They’d been swimming in places that no one could hear\
When she longed for her soul, he said come on dear\
\
‘Cause that’s just the way things here get done\
By running around, by selling your crown\
You think that you’re riding on top, but you are\
Just chasing a dream, breathless and scarred
