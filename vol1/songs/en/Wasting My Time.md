# Wasting My Time

So I became an expert\
At wasting all my time\
Seeking some real answers\
I've flown into your eyes\
\
And suddenly I'm dizzy\
Wasted,\
Out of time\
\
No more seeking answers\
Spinning ‘round my mind\
Using all the same old words\
Rhyming time with thyme\
\
Nothing has been brokered\
Since I had you, inside\
Nothing\
\
And now that this song is over\
I'm back to wasting just my time\
The feeling is over too\
And words care not if rhymed\
\
It’s back to washing dishes\
To standing on my head\
Back to selling tickets\
To stations of the dread
