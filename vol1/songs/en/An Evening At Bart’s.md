# An Evening At Bartâ€™s

They came in, with their new cars\
Their caravans, their costly bikes\
Their guitars all shining\
With bridges made of tusk\
\
Old models and new\
All name-plated in gold\
Their straps without a scratch\
No stories have they told\
\
And the melodies they played\
Were pretty, fast and sleek\
No chord was out of place\
No string did miss a pick\
\
Their private schooling it did show\
Through the starch-marks on their shirts\
Their boots were clean as new\
Not ever have seen dirt\
\
The ladies were all versed\
In the art of the mystique\
No tooth has gone missing\
Beneath their lips of red lipstick\
\
And although picking was not their game\
They sure could read and rhyme\
At least enough, so it seemed\
For poetry of old times \
\        
But when he played, he set upright\
His muddy boots ajar\
His fingernails all dirty\
From working on his car\
\
His timeworn nylon strings\
Were probably a century old\
But no one took a breath\
As the music stories told\
\
"I was not but a child of six\
Then living on a boat\
When a neighbor gave me a gramophone\
I might be musical, he thought\
\
And so, from Bach harmony I learnt\
From Mozart parts to sort\
From Schubert the art of love\
And from my dad, a dozen different kinds of knots\
\
We moved around a lot them days\
School boys of many I fought\
By the age of fifteen\
I was nimble as a mountain goat\
\
A vessel of the sea\
I will build me, I thought\
So for the pound\
The streets with music I hawked\
\
And now, I'm here\
Nor am I schooled or vessel gained\
And unlike many of you\
I have rambled a-many in the rain\
\
But my back it is strong\
My music it is real\
My senses are alive\
The turning of the seasons I still feel\
\
You may think you're trained\
Polished and taught\
But the art of living\
Is not with money bought\
\
But by doing the essentials\
By thinking some bare thoughts\
By picking apples from the ground\
Before they all rot\
\
So stand up, go outside\
Into the cold\
And pay no heed to fear or pain\
Your souls are almost done for and sold\

You may forget me now\
Or forever me scold\
But live your life\
Be you young or old\
\
And now I will leave you\
I will depart\
Because for me\
There is no fresh start\
\
The car still needs me\
To repair\
So long friends, be well\
Do not despair"\
\
So gazing sadly\
They all got up\
Picked up their instruments\
Cases now shut\
\
And bowed farewell to the host\
The owner of the hut\
A meek and quiet creature\
By the name of Bart
