# Being Happy & Free

It's everywhere, you see\
People like you and me\
Running back into the sea\
Falling in love that can not be\
Trying hard to get free\
From their own misery\

Once I thought that being free\
Meant running around, carelessly\
Pushing luck endlessly\
Losing the kids, the family\
Shutting out the tyranny\
Of mid-life's destiny\
\
"Don't reach out!\
Don't peek out!\
Don't look away!\
Lest you'll stray!\
We fed you once\
Now it's your turn\
To pay us back\
With guilt and shame\
\               
Now don't you fear\
Your time will come\
When your kids break\
The code, the rhyme\
We'll see you then\
Being happy and free\
Singing songs of love\
In a minor key‚Äù\
\
Well, you've heard my folks, they disagree\
With falling in love, with being free\
With running back into the sea\
With falling in love that can not be\
With trying hard to get free\
From their own misery
