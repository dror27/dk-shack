# Staying Inside

I sit here wondering\
If the skies are gonna’ fall\
When I’ll flip back the switch\
And be back in control\
Will it be dark?\
Or will I be able to fix it all?\
\
‘Cause you know the steps\
We need to take to stand up tall\
Are really not that much\
They’re really pretty small\
But we end up holding\
Fearing the worst\
The worst of it all\
\
But I feel stronger today\
Better equipped, as some people say\
I’m learning the signs\
Leading back to your heart\
Staying inside\
Without being tied\
\        
I use to think\
That I was headed for a fall\
The kind that wrecks it all\
So everything gets told\
I was so sure\
I almost reached my goal\
\
I took you all the way\
And tried a little more\
I’ve worked out schemes\
So you would throw me out the door\
I’ve stretched your patience\
Made you aware\
Asked you truth or dare\
\
But I feel stronger today\
Better equipped, as some people say\
I’m learning the signs\
Leading back to your heart\
Staying inside\
Without being tied
