# Music Is My Mistress

Music is my mistress\
Whenever I’m away\
She always seems to find me\
And then I lose way again\
Her heart is always open\
Her back is never turned away\
‘Cause music is my mistress\
And one day she’ll be here to stay\
\
Music is my mistress\
She opens up my day\
She draws away the curtains\
Gives freedom to my prayers\
And even when she’s leaving\
She lightens up the way\
‘Cause music is my mistress\
And one day she’ll be here to stay\
\
Music is my mistress\
And if she was a girl, I’d say:\
I’ve known you for a lifetime\
I held you in my arms each day\
And now that you are with me\
It’s time for you to lay your head\
‘Cause music is my mistress\
And you, my love, are here to stay\
