# Call Me

It’s been a year, four months and a day\
Since that time you slipped away\
Disappeared right out of sight\
Where do you lay your head, my dear, tonight?\
\
Empty stations, all alone\
Beaten, hungry to the bone\
You lost the sparkle in your eyes\
Can you still recall your other life?\
\
Call me, I’m waiting by the phone\
Counting milliseconds since you’re gone
Call me, I’m singing you this song\
To keep you company when you’re alone\
\
Way back then you felt so strong\
With righteousness you fought all wrong\
Slamming doors and telephones\
Taking cues from vapors all along\
\
Then you lost your sense of smell\
With false alarm you lost the trail\
Swapping insight for mistrust\
Cutting off your memories and past\
\
Call me, I’m waiting by the phone\
Counting milliseconds since you’re gone\
Call me, I’m singing you this song\
To keep you company when you’re alone\
\        
Maybe one day, when you’re at home\
All fixed up, your child’s all grown\
One a random station, you’ll hear this song\
When you’ll turn your head, I’ll be already gone\
\
So call me, I’m waiting by the phone\
Counting milliseconds since you’re gone\
Call me, I’m singing you this song\
To keep you company when you’re alone\
