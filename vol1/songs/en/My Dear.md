# My Dear

It's been six years since my girl left me\
I wonder why she still attracts me\
I work so hard trying to fix myself\
I try so hard, but I can't escape\
It's been six years since my girl left me\
\
It's been six months since I first saw your face\
I wonder why I think we're in the race\
I work so hard trying to fix myself\
I try so hard, but I can't escape\
It's been six months since I first saw your face\
\
It's every round, like it's the first\
Like I never been there, never seen the place\
It's been six months since I first saw your face\
\
It's been six days since I left you alone\
I wonder why I still think you're my own\
I work so hard trying to fix myself\
I try so hard, but I can't escape\
It's been six days since I left you alone\
\
It's every round, like it's the first\
Like I never been there, never seen the place\
I work so hard trying to fix myself\
I try so hard, but I can't escape\
\        
My mind\
The life, I could find\
The lies, I left behind\
And you, you are so kind\
\
It's been six hours since we last kissed my dear\
I wonder how can I still feel you near\
I've worked so hard trying to fix myself\
But it finally feels like I found my place\
It's been six hours since we last kissed my dear\
\
Now every round feels like first and last\
Like I've always been there, even in the past\
It's been six hours since we last kissed my dear
