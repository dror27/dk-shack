# Sadness Is Effective

It’s a Spanish Friday\
At the bar, “The House of Stone”\
He’s getting slowly fired\
Drinks a shot of his cologne\
\
Packs up his Cry-Baby\
Grabs a coat, it’s getting cold\
Burns out the tires\
Says: “Lest old memories be old”\
\
Down at the homestead\
The fire’s gone, but there’s no rush\
She’s in her early fifties\
The house’s empty, dark & plush\
\
The Rolls is waiting\
It drives itself for all she knows\
Her high heels clicking\
As she opens up the door\
\
She says:\
“Sadness is effective\
If you give it a try\
Happiness is petty cash\
For those who can not cry”\
\
They’re on the stage now\
His fingers dance, she taps the floor\
The crowd is cheering\
Boss is smiling at the door\
\
But something’s telling\
Of a night they spent before\
Out on the desert, where\
Lust their faith forever stole\
\
They say:\
“Sadness is effective\
If you give it a try\
Happiness is petty cash\
For those who can not cry”\
\
Now, faith’s a liar\
It’s always right after the fact\
But so is crying\
When it’s put to the test\
\
But still they're trying\
Bones and feathers, lips and all\
To fathom flying\
From the threshold of the door\
\
They say:\
“Sadness is effective\
If you give it a try\
Happiness is petty cash\
For those who can not cry”\
\
The chicks have hatched a fountain\
Far away from the storm\
Coast is slowly burning\
Soon be time to fetch some coal\
\
They’re stalking daylight\
Waiting on a chance to flee\
Comforts of steady living\
To be jerked down like a flea\
\
They say:\
“Sadness is effective\
If you give it a try\
Happiness is petty cash\
For those who can not cry”\
\
But through the darkness of his eyes\
He’s shouting out in vain\
The way he feels is whole & pleasant\
But really not the same\
\
Howling out madly, he’s been\
Drowned out by the rain\
Then for a few short moments\
He’s in her basement - pain\
\
Seventeen, and counting\
Bodies just keep piling up\
Unashamed he’s smiling\
Stoned he gazes while they fuck\
\
He’s rising to the top\
Screaming out his lungs\
He sobs into the curtain\
“Where are you now?”\
Is this the sentence?\
Or glory to be found?\
\
“Silence Is Golden”\
Says the sign above the coat\
“Practice Your Omens”\
Says the preacher serving faults\
“You Never Know What’s Coming”\
Says the housewife to the womb\
“God Is Always Loving”\
Says the waiting to be cured\
\
As the sun rose up this morning\
From the east\
People woke up, went to work\
Clenching their fists\
\
California’s dreaming\
But there’s no yeast, no more\
I feel like Hell in knocking\
At my door\
\
Silhouettes of human kindness\
Staring out of the finest\
Dining establishments\
On Main street, menus getting tired\
\
Battered house of saints\
Long knives, beaters and stakes\
The prey is waiting, meek in garment\
For it’s time, for the mistake\

Still, the stillness bears no witness\
In the sky\
Fear of coming off as desperate\
Is something to despise\
\
Sadness IS effective\
If you give it a try\
Happiness is petty cash\
For those who can not cry\
