# I’m Wining Still

Yes, I’m winning, like never before\
Call in the keeper of all score\
Go tell the masses, I’m doing well\
Charmed as ever, ain’t living swell\
\
Save from some missing teeth\
I’m still a sweet kisser of lips and feet\
Bound for glory, ready for defeat\
Cynical naysayers out to cheat\
\
No pills for me, just an evening stroll\
A corner of a smile I once stole\
From a girl I knew then, before\
Now a wonder-woman, then slave to chore\
\
Silly old geezer, skinny milk deceiver\
I’d be no veggie cult believer\
Insurance schemes - out the door\
Health care not worth dying for\
\
I’ll love to live, live to love\
Shovel coal, if push comes to shove\
Make bets on the weather\
Put my trust upon a feather\
Be a simpleton\
Forever\
\        
Now some of you may think me dim\
Just because I don’t take my milk skim\
So excuse me while I kiss the cream\
Drink myself silly, court with steam\
\
No worries for me, I’m winning still\
Chopping wood down at the mill\
For if you find me with a chap called Phil\
Know I’m well, not quite yet over that hill
