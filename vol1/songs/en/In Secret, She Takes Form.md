# In Secret, She Takes Form

Cots, pots and billy goats\
Sautéed shallots and rust belt trots\
River floats, forks and wedding posts\
Midnight talks and bobbing yachts\
\
Hazard mocks punctual clocks\
A midwife’s work, suspended a-halt\
By a ghostly chalk, a figurine docked\
To a mantelpiece poked, by an iron spoke\
\
Null thoughts, idle deeds provoke\
Soon she’s fraught, excited to gloat\
Escaping the moth, desire it plots\
Snow boots on, gloves, a coat\
\
Warmth aborts, she scurries across\
Bridleways, paths, a bride at loss\
Submitting to frost, a measly cost\
Joyous to most, to self a faux\
\
An Eskimo elder, queening by rote\
Perishes slowly, but leaves life not\
A village in morn, wails as a mutt\
Whilst in a forest, erected stands a hut\
\
Comes summer, ice to rivers succumb\
Schools of fish to term they come\
Ghostly figurines as tree-sticks form\
Crystal visions, ‘round her hilltop dorm\
\
Slowly, in rot or cheerful as storm\
Knowledge is short, on all things to come\
For being alive or in catacombs\
She, as is time, in secret takes form
