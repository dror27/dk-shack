# Reach Out

Reach Out\
Try and touch the things that fear you most\
See how they can disappear as ghosts\
Watch them fade away as you draw near\
It’s coming clear\
The pain behind the fear – is gone\
\
It’s time for you to start now feeling right\
To feel your body and soul being tight\
To work your way outside\
Into a world that understands\
With no need to pretend – at all\
\
Recall\
When you first fell you had no one to call\
When you first knew you had to do it all\
It’s changing now, your wish is coming true\
It’s all for you\
Even when you’re blue – it’s fine
