# Leaving For The Summer

I’m leaving for the summer\
‘Think I’ll go and find me a place\
Where the trees are plenty\
Where I can finally relate\
\
I’ve been waiting for a sign\
I’ve been plotting out inside\
I’ve been wasted all that time\
\
I think I’ll go out to the country\
Give my own medicine a taste\
Walk along the narrow coast\
Until I finally erase\
\
Everything I’ve ever known\
From the flesh down to the bone\
Until I’m one with the stones\
\
And when I’ll go to the country\
I think I’ll find me an honest priest\
Or some random stranger in a store\
Get it all out until I weep\
\
How I took you from behind\
How I turned myself to be blind\
How I’m really not that kind\
\        
Now you heard my story\
Do you think it’s fine\
That I will go out hungry\
And forget you for a while?\
\
Find a girl that I once knew\
Kiss her on the cheek and we’ll be through\
Hey baby, what’s it to you?\
If It was you, what would you do?\
\
Here’s to friendship, love love me do\
We’ve got a lifetime before we’re through\
\
So I’ll go out walking for a while\
And I’ll try to work it off somehow
