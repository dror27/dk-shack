# Member Of Mankind

In the beginning there was man alone\
Then came the angles, humming to a song\
Which took the shape of a chain and a stone\
So man learned to walk, with his feet pressed to the floor\
He drew fire from the skies and smoked the leaves\
Then he decided it’s time to leave\
\
He got the axe he’s been hiding in the shed\
Cracked up the chain and almost cut off his leg\
And at that instance he began to float\
Like a bubble of Champaign from a bottle he once bought\
And as he reached the surface he did cry\
‘Cause he knew he was about to die\
\
Now isn’t it a pity, that a creature so refined\
Will always to accepted as a member of mankind\
By the mere fact he’s born and bound to die\
Even if his life is just a lie\
\
So for the uninitiated, I’ll rewind\
And explain the situation, called the existential grind\
That consumes all the resources that one has\
From the moment we are born till the day that we are dead\
For the simplest of all purpose – just to be\
Now go figure why we ever left the tree\
\        
Is it so we can plow our fields until they’re dry?\
Or that we can make some money? or screw some on the side?\
Maybe we can even re-elect\
The very same people that us boldly so neglect?\
Or to find the true velocity of light?\
Make a bomb that we can safely drop at night\
\
Now isn’t it a pity, that a creature so refined\
Will always to accepted as a member of mankind\
By the mere fact he’s born and bound to die\
Even if his life is just a lie\
\
So to set the record straight, before we go\
Before the bubble bursts, before we’re silently disposed\
Let us give the art of living one more chance\
Spin the wheel of fortune, maybe even risk romance\
And be a part of what we call Humanity\
In spite of how absurd that crowd might be\
\
Now isn’t it a pity, that a creature so refined\
Will always to accepted as a member of mankind\
By the mere fact he’s born and bound to die\
Even if his life is just a lie
