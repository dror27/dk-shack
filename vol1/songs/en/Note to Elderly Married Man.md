# Note to Elderly Married Man

Here I am, back on the phone\
Trying to get you away from your home\
Trying to make run away with me\
But I know I’ll never be free\
\
Safely protected in my married state\
So I can make advances and never copulate\
\
Here I am, texting a line\
Writing something that’ll draw your mind\
Temping you wander and stray\
But I know I’ll never do it anyway\
\
Safely protected in my married state\
So I can make advances and never copulate\
\
Now you call me a fool but never ask why, why I didn’t try\
Now you call me a coward but never ask how\
How you came to love me, and why\
\
Safely protected in my married state\
So I can make advances and never copulate\
\
Now I’m single, what do you know\
No more powers, nothing to show\
Can’t say a word, can’t pick up a dime\
I’m no longer a man in his prime, no longer -\
\
Safely protected in my married state\
So I can make advances and never copulate\
