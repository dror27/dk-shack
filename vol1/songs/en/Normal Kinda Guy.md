# Normal Kinda Guy

When we first met\
You wanted rough\
I played along\
We bought some stuff\
\
I told myself:\
Love's worth a try\
I'll work it out\
I’m just a normal kinda guy\
\
Then we moved in\
You robbed a bank\
I watched you bleed\
Inside I cracked\
\
I told myself:\
Big boys don't cry\
I'll work it out\
I’m just a normal kinda guy\
\
Blood on my shirt, head’s full of screams\
I no longer care where you've been\
\
Today I'm leaving\
Goodbye neglect\
Surprised my darling?\
What did you expect?\
\
I'm telling myself\
No more drama and red-eye\
I'm cutting it out\
I’m just a normal kinda guy
