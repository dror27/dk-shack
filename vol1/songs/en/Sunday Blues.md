# Sunday Blues

I was born on a Sunday\
Old man preacher, he called out my name\
He said: “you might not be a believer\
But one day you’re going to be a man”\
\
I got into my first fight on a Sunday\
Took a man’s soul and dumped it to the ground\
Daddy took me by the arm, saying:\
“You better not be doing this while I’m around”\
\
Daddy left us on a Sunday\
The sky turned blue like a blindman’s eye\
Mommy woke us early, saying:\
“We’re gonna go to church and you’re gonna smile”\
\
I made love to my first girl on a Sunday\
Man, it felt so good I almost cried\
Her brother got out the shotgun, saying: \
“You’re gonna marry this girl or you gonna die”\
\
My first boy was born on a Sunday\
Kissed his cheek and left that very same day\
‘Cause I knew I was a deadbeat\
I wouldn’t be doing him good anyway\
\
Now I’m sitting on my porch, and it’s a Sunday\
Lord, I know I’m gonna die today\
My soul is ready for you now\
Won’t you come down and take it away\
\        
Well, they say that Heaven feels like Sunday\
Ice-cream and peaches everyday\
But you won’t find me there, not for a moment\
‘Cause here in Hell is where I’ll stay\
\
Here in Hell there is no Sunday\
Every day is a hard working day\
But it suits me just fine, because\
There ain’t no judgement on a seventh day\
\
Now I’m a man with no Sundays\
Can’t do no right, can’t do no wrong\
But I’m happy and sad just the same\
‘Cause any other way, I won’t be singing this song
