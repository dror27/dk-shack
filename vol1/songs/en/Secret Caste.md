# Secret Caste

Myriad of rainbows upon me\
A Berlin wall falls a-sea\
Rodents flying in midair\
Poverty no more than a mildest scare\
\
Fascinated, bewildered, frank\
Meet me at the border, at dusk\
I'll be the accordion man, wearing a mask\
You be the Indian dancer, wearing earrings of tusk\
\
Tomorrow there’ll be chaos and shock\
People running the streets amok\
Serpents will be ruling cars\
Down to a halt, controlled from afar\
\
But today we rule, we cast\
We make living a must\
We fly our flags high a-mast\
Supreme we are, a secret caste\
\
Tomorrow there’ll be chaos and shock\
People running the streets amok\
Serpents will be ruling cars\
Down to a halt, controlled from afar
