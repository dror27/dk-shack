# Respectful Of Time

From the nose to the fin\
She's all sanctity, no sin\
In her bowels, deep within\
I've been churning the best of my years\
\
Where no man has set foot\
Lies her treasure, the loot\
Spacious visions of fruit\
I've been serving away as my youth\
\
Soaking deep to the skin\
I've been searching for kin\
But all around where I've been\
Forgetful the faces they seem\

But I'll scan the divine\
The accidental and kind\
Till I find what is mine\
Until then I'll be patient, respectful of time
