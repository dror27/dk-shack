# Here We Go Again

All it takes is one more search\
Keyboard’s waiting for you\
Quote her first and last name, and a place\
Suddenly she’s on the screen with you\
\
Memories are coming through\
Of forest hikes and eyes of blue\
She’s with you - or it is true?
\
All it takes is one more step\
Your heart is calling you\
Pinch yourself for this is real\
Freedom is found in what you do\
\
Memories are coming strong\
Of secret hideouts, letters torn\
Now she’s gone, into a song\
\
Here we go again, pretending we’re just friends\
Here we go again, telling there’s no end\
\
But the time, it keeps on rolling by\
And your mind, it keeps on wanting love\
\        
Maybe this one will be saved\
From this game you play so well\
Thinking clearly only twists your head\
Now’s the time for some show and tell\
\
Memories are sealed a-due\
Chatting with you only makes me blue\
‘Guess it’s true - something in me still loves you\
\
Here we go again, pretending we’re just friends\
Here we go again, telling there’s no end\
\
But the time, it keeps on rolling by\
And your mind, it keeps on wanting love\
\
Still memories are coming through\
Of forest hikes and eyes of blue\
Yes, memories are coming strong\
Of secret hideouts, letters torn\
‘Guess, it’s true - something in me still loves you\
\
Here we go again, pretending we’re just friends\
Here we go again,telling there’s no end\
\
But the time, it keeps on rolling by\
And your mind, it keeps on wanting love\
