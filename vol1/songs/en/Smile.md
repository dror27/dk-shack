# Smile

There's a flower bright and gay\
There's a mother crying today\
For everything a price to pay today\
\
There's a clock up on the wall\
There's a sign, says: "Pay the Toll"\
To build a-new, we first destroy today\
\
But flowers need no mending\
People need no telling\
Clocks will keep on ticking\
Till we know\
To let it go and Smile!\
\
There's a world you can not see\
There's a sun you can not feel\
There's a sound you can not hear today\
\
Reach across your very arms\
Straighten your back and drop your guns\
Imagine you're the chosen one today\
\
'Cause flowers need no mending\
People need no telling\
Clocks will keep on ticking\
Till we know\
To let it go and Smile!\
