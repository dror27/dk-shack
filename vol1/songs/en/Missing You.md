# Missing You

You say\
I doesnâ€™t matter what I say\
All the time we spent is gone now\
Taken out\
\
You cry\
I'm not even asking why\
Your head's up in the sky now\
Your alive\
\
When I ask you to explain\
You say: I really can't complain\
Seven years ago\
I might have loved you to feel strong\
\
But now, I'm questioning my doubts\
\
You sigh\
As if there's something left to try\
You're asking the wrong people\
For advice\
\
You speak\
But in the evening we must part as we drift\
Disconnect the tether\
Bring it home\
\
When I ask you to explain\
You say we never go back again\
All the time we spent is lost\
You left out wondering about the cost\
\
Do you still have time for me, my friend?\
Did you really worry, do did you just pretend?\

From the edge of the sky I'm looking too\
When I'm feeling fine, I'm missing you\
\
So when I ask you to explain\
You say that it really feels the same\
When I question your advice\
You look away and roll the dice\
\
Did I miss your face again today, my friend?\
Can you tell your life has changed, now that you're dead?
