# Out Of The Shadows

I met a young girl, down in Mexico\
She walked me out of the way\
We hitched a ride across the blue sky\
And headed down the day\
\
She asked for my name, as I came up\
I didn’t know what to say\
She called me love as I went down\
Down her legs, where I did stay\
\
Now you tell me, what is the force\
That attracts a girl\
To such a fine old specimen\
Who likes just to play\
\
Now I’m telling you, here’s my thought\
You need not beauty nor wealth\
I came across many young women there\
That I now know pretty well\
\        
And then said the girl, with a certain smile\
Oh, you’re surly just like me\
I wander this world not knowing why\
While I keep searching for my misery\
\
She then stopped and told me her life was in a rut\
Running and playing in the fields\
Until one day a man came into the light\
And then she slowly disappeared\
\
Now you tell me, what’s a man to do\
In such a crazy circumstance\
Should he get out to the field and run with no end\
Should he stay and learn to prance\
\
Well, I did what I did, you’ll have to figure it out\
I’m not telling you a thing\
I’m coming out of the shadows, into the light\
Down again, your way
