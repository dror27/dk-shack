# No Longer Needed

Take your wives out to the sea\
Where the sand and sun are free\
Till they're crying out for love\
Asking only to be free\
\
From the kids that they have born\
From the scars that time has worn\
From all decency and creed\
Till their hearts no longer bleed\
\
And as they thank you for the ride\
Wave your hand, put on a smile\
\
Take your boys out to the streets\
Give them music and critique\
Till they stay awake all night\
Getting ready for the fight\
\
Against all ordinary form\
Against all law and uniform\
Till they're ready to ascend\
To the life you've always planned\
\
And as they thank you for the ride\
Wave your hand, put on a smile\
You're no longer needed\
We know it all, now we're even\
\
So is a man to live alone?\
From himself he's never torn\
Or should he open up the gates\
For the class of 88?\
\
Should he take it all in stride\
Wave them off and stay inside?\
Or should he go out to fulfill\
His new dream, up on the hill?\
\
And thank them all for the ride\
Wave his hand and smile with pride?\
