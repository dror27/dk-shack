# Take Off Your Clothes & Leave The Room

Take off your clothes and leave the room\
There’s nothing waiting for you here but tears and gloom\
It’s time for you to take a knife and pierce the womb\
So take off your clothes and leave the room\
\
It’s time for you to put your bare feet to the floor\
It’s time for you to charge into the cold\
No one’s waiting to see your face ‘round here no more\
So take off your clothes and out the door\
\
At first, you’ll feel alone, a little dizzy\
But then, you’ll feel at home, ‘cause it’s easy\
\
To be strong, to be safe\
To be exactly you and no one else\
To be free of having to see\
Opinionated people just like me\
You’ll be the queen, of some wonderland\
In a Disney fantasy\
\
But you won’t see me\
As I creep from behind\
To light up the fire\
In your mind\
\
I’m gonna make you kind\
I’m gonna dress you fine\
I’m gonna take my time\
I’m gonna make you mine
