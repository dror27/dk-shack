# The Fear

Sometimes, the fear is just too much\
I long to get closer, to feel, to touch\
To cross unstable bridges, walk doomed paths\
To revenge all cynics, moguls of trust\

Sometimes, the fear is just too small\
I get this momentary feeling I can do it all\
Break a window of glass and pour it down my soul\
Preach my way to heaven, heed my nature's call\
\
And sometimes, the fear is just a fear\
An fictional stumbling block, to be sincere\
I make it up to be all, just to be clear\
To get one more round, with you, my dear
