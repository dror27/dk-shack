# All That Time

All that time I’ve been thinking of you\
It never crossed my mind\
That you were someone I could choose\
To be a friend of mine\
\
All that time, I’ve been riding along\
All that time, I’ve been writing this song\
\
All that time I’ve been watching you\
I never had a doubt\
That you won’t hear me as I speak\
Or even if I shout\
\
All that time, I’ve been riding along\
All that time, I’ve been writing this song\
\
And now that I met you, around the bend\
Showed you my garden, and gave you my hand\
Will you step outside, and be my friend?\
Will you step outside, and call me your man?\
\
All that time, it’s mine to keep Forever and again\
Your voice I hear, your lips they move\
For me it’s all the same\
\
All that time, I’ve been playing along\
All that time, I’ve been writing this song\
