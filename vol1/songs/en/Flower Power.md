# Flower Power

Life is simple, here on the ranch\
You wake up in the morning, water the plants\
Shave past recalls off your cheek\
Eat your daily portion of fresh leek\
\
Townes' backyard is coming alive\
With guitars a-buzzing, my own beehive\
Pretty rundown but standing tall\
Wait no more, or so I'm told\
\
Flower power gained by lilies I consume\
Nothing but the kindness of nature I assume\
\
But far asleep, deep underneath\
A mammoth beast inside me breaths\
In short lurching growls it speaks\
World destruction and havoc it reeks\
\
Flower power gained by lilies I consume\
Nothing but the kindness of nature I assume\
\
I'm ready, to live and speak\
The language of the simpletons and meek\
Let the roving ants be our private fleet\
Come my love, let's eat\
\
Flower power gained by lilies I consume\
Nothing but the kindness of nature I assume
