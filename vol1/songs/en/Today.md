# Today

When you say:\
"Everything will be OK"\
Do you mean you're going away, today?\
\
When you say:\
"Look at me and ask me twice"\
Do you mean itâ€™s time to close our eyes?\
\
Today, the feeling's gone astray\
Today, the feeling's gone away\
\
When you say:\
"I'll always be right by your side"\
Is it time for me to start to cry?\
\
When you say:\
"I'll never be away from you"\
Is it time for me for being blue?\
\
Today, the feeling's gone astray\
Today, the feeling's gone away\
\
When you say:\
"Everything is going to be OK"\
When you say ... everything's away\
Today, the feeling's gone away
