# Congratulations

I’m sleeping outside\
I’ve got nowhere else to go\
I’m cutting out the ties\
Burning bridges, slamming doors\
The future looks certain\
Yes, I’m headed for the fall\
\
Situations, they’re driving me again\
Hesitation, no longer you’re my friend\
Complications, waiting around the bend\
Congratulations, it's getting near the end\
\
There used to be a time\
When all joy has turned to fault\
When cheering up a friend\
Turned into a game with danger fraught\
When fixing it up\
Meant plunging deep into sloth\
\
Now I’m in situations, they’re driving me again\
Hesitation, no longer you’re my friend\
Complications, waiting around the bend\
Congratulations, it's getting near the end
