# Patiently

I really feel we’ve got something, she tells me\
I really feel we’ve gone this way before\
I really feel you’re pushing me over\
And I feel, mountains over hills\
\
I really think you’re coming in too heavy for my size\
I really think you’ve gone too far, so I can not decide\
I really think you’re pushing me\
And I can’t live like that any more\
\
But is there something I can say\
To make you change your way\
‘Cause I feel left out
But is there a word that I can slip\
A song that I can sing\
‘Cause I feel left out, on my own\
\
She says, you’ve tried it all,\
And now it’s my turn to show you how\
To do and speak, to recognize\
To live with me somehow\
She says, it’s my way\
And I’m gonna show you how\
\
But is there something I can do\
To make you change your mind\
’bout me and you\
We could have hit it off this time, I know\
What would you say if I took your hand\
Shook you up and made you understand\
I’m not like that anymore\
I don’t want it all,\
Just want to be happy at home\
\
She says, I think I figured you out\
You’re one of those guys who want it all\
And then they just run out\
I’m tired of all these ins and outs that are going in my life\
I want it now, to last for all night long\
\
But is there someplace I can go\
Or somewhere I can hide\
For you to be able\
To track me down when you cry\
Is there a place where I should be\
Where I’ll cover my misery\
And wait for you, to show up there\
And be with me\
