# Me & You

When I first saw you\
You were all dressed in white\
Nothing much was said\
As we boarded the flight\
\
Twenty minutes into the storm\
You reached for a bag about to fall\
Then I saw your panties\
You were wearing none at all\
\
Now it's seven days and seven nights\
And I can’t get you out of my mind\
I’ve been touring, sold out, out of sight\
Not a face I recognize\
\
I got people calling me\
Asking me to sing, to be free\
But I can’t get you out of my mind\
\
So I’m not wearing underwear at all\
That’s the way it’s gonna be\
Right now, in another world\
It’s just you and me
