# Cover Your Behind

It’s the sound of your voice\
That hurts me the most\
It’s the way that you smile\
That brings a tear to my eye\
\
It’s the way that you dress\
All that phony success\
The way you reach for the door\
Instead of asking for more\
\
But I’m here, writing you a line\
No more hiding, or keeping it all inside\
Yes, I’m patient, better cover your behind\
\
Yes, your feelings are true\
Yes, I'm coming for you\
Better let down the shades\
Block the top of the stairs\
\
Now I’m here, writing you a line\
No more hiding, or keeping it all inside\
Yes, I’m patient, better cover your behind\
\
Now you’re feeling the pain\
And you want it again\
The forbidden fruit\
Got you grabbing your boot\
\
Still I’m here, writing you a line\
No more hiding, or keeping it all inside\
Yes, I’ve been patient, now you cover your behind
