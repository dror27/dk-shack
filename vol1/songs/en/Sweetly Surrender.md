# Sweetly Surrender

The first time that I saw you\
You looked so fine\
Love was in your eyes\
I imagined you were mine\
Then the night came, we stopped\
I wasn't so sure it'll work\
\
Then another day came\
With you again\
The sun kept running\
Through the sand\
I left you for another\
She cried hard on my shoulder\
\
For the stars, the sound\
My beating heart is lost and found\
I'm running out of signs to decipher\
Listening in my sleep\
\
Morning creeps in from behind\
I find I'm really doing fine\
And all this happiness is breathing me back to life\
Feeling free and laughing, lost in time\
\
Be here, mine, for the moment\
Will you be kind enough to say I do\
I'm missing you\
\
And now itâ€™s time to say goodbye\
I'm gonna' cherish it all inside\
The moment's pleasant, just read the sign:\
"Sweetly surrender this lullaby"
