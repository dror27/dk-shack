# My Love Is Big

My love it is big\
It gets bigger every day\
Won't you come down and hug me\
My baby's away\
\
My will is strong\
It gets stronger every day\
Won't you come down and test me\
My baby's away\
\
I'm thinking deep thoughts\
Getting deeper every day\
Won't you come down and show me some kindness\
My baby's away\
\
You might think that I'm dirty\
Getting dirtier every day\
Won't you come down and clean me\
My baby's away\
/        
Life seems so hard\
That's what I hear people saying\
Well I'm gonna make it easy on you\
My baby's away\
\
You can rob and steal and cheat\
To get what you want\
Today might be my lucky day\
But honey please don't\
\
'Cause my love it is big\
It gets bigger every day\
Won't you come down and hug me\
My baby's away
