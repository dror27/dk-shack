# Stop

You had your luck\
Now it’s running out\
You gave all that you got\
Now you got no one to blame\
You're feeling the pain, again\
\
You're fighting it back\
You are trying in vain\
Reinventing yourself and again\
You're back where you belong\
Just feeling alone\
\
Your friends they can't tell\
If you're for or against\
Given them up, or trying your best\
So stop, don't look around\
For answers you've already found\
\
I've seen it before\
That note on the door\
That says: I don't want it no more\
It’s heavy and there're too much pain\
I'm not falling for this one again\
\
‘Cause I know what's behind\
This retraction of yours\
It’s the fear that it’s wrong and he knows\
And if so, are you willing to stare\
Straight into my eyes\
And tell me you're scared?\
\
'Cause I really can't tell\
If you're for or against\
Given me up, or trying your best\
So stop, don't look around\
For answers you've already found\
