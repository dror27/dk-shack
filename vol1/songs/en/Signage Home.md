# Signage Home

(stream of consciousness) \
\
There’s no sign to explain\
To tell us where to turn\
There’s no price tag on the loss\
Covering our cost\
\
Two people laid out in the sand\
A whole world trying to understand\
\
There’s no mother left to cry\
Or even just to try\
There’s no father to meet\
Across the street\
\
Two people laid out in the sand\
A whole world trying to understand\
\
And I’m left out wondering why\
I didn’t try to walk away, instead I sighed\
And I’m left out wondering where\
I touched your hair and made you understand\
\
Two people laid out in the sand\
A whole world trying to understand\
\
There’s no way to tell it nice\
There’s always a price\
There’s no happy end to the tale\
There’s just the pain\
\
Two people laid out in the sand\
A whole world trying to understand
