# Let Your Body Be Your Mind

You've been away, you took your time\
You lost your mind, now you are mine\
Locked in a basement of a house you never been to\
I'll be kind\
\
I'll spare you all the courtesy\
The higher praise, the sublime\
And when you scream your anger out\
I'll tell you: you'll be fine\
\
I'm leaving you for a while\
When you wake up you'll be fine\
Some things are better left behind\
Just let your body be your mind\
\
Itâ€™s becoming dark and cold\
Your feet are numb, your shoulder cry\
The chains cut through your flesh\
You barely move, but yet you smile\
\
As silhouettes appear before your eyes\
You wave them off until they die\
Then morning creeps in through the shades\
Some cars are passing by\
\
I'm leaving you for a while\
When you wake up you'll be fine\
Some things are better left behind\
Just let your body be your mind
