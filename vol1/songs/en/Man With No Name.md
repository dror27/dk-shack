# Man With No Name

Amid all known beauty and shame\
Lies a man who says he bears no name\
Surrounded by voices he speaks\
Of the future, with a madly streak\
\
And around him, the circle, it grows\
In their eyes the desire the know\
But their stomach it quivers inside\
For they fear he's truly their guide\
\
Yet his speech is so clear and direct\
To their knees they must fall and neglect\
Petty crimes, great schemes of grand wealth\
Future wives, clutching babes to their breast\
\
So into darkness they march, to unite\
With their secrets, in halls oh' so bright\
Until their vision is so gravely impaired\
And of reality they're never again scared\
\
And with all new freedom, as found\
Bodies risen from beds, to the ground\
Till all earth is filled with lust and deceit\
For their bodies still bound in defeat\
\
So they turn to the one at the door\
To revenge their demise, they implore\
Of the man with no name, hands with ore\
To commence his death, to even up the score\
\
Still, amid all known beauty and shame\
Lies a man who says he bears no name\
Surrounded by voices he speaks\
Of the future, with a madly streak\
