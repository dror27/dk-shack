# Lockdown Locksmith

Birmingham, the city of a thousand trades, is in lockdown, again. 

With the memories of its first lockdown submerged safely into to its collective subconscious, and high on hopes for a comeback Christmas season, the city’s stop button was once again depressed. 

Or was it?

Leaving New-Street Station on a sunny Wednesday, we set sail to find out. 

At this point I should clarify that when I say we, I don’t mean the Royal We, nor should you imagine a bearded soundman and a producer chasing this zestful reporter. It was just me, Dror, and my slender bodied companion of ten years, a good old iPhone 4S, made in China.

So on to Chinatown we descended, to find a Birmingham tradesman, in lockdown, again.

At the gates of town, lies the Leeway Store, an oriental supermarket. And leeway to it, as the wind blows, tucked under the massive train station’s building, nestles a small and tidy looking workshop: Birmingham Master Locksmiths. 

I walk in, with a mask and a smile;

The owner, Craig Maguire, master of his domain, promptly rises up from his black swivel chair, as I step inside. He eyes me from his 6 foot 3 vantage point, searching for a clue as to what kind of key I might need to sort out. 

I give him my standard opening, flash my BCU card and pronounce in a noticeably foreign accent: I’m doing a story on how lockdown 2 is different than lockdown 1. Do you mind if I record this? 

Big mistake! I’m now noticing Craig’s arms for the first time, tattoos and all. These arms have probably gotten many apeople out of a jam. I might need some unjamming here too,  and fast. Inside goes the recorder and surprisingly enough Craig kicks into lecture mode:

“Lockdown 2 is different. More people are wearing masks. There is still some traffic. Lockdown 1 was total closure. People have learned.”

Have you had anyone in the store today, I ask? “Sure, two or three walk-ins. Still, I’m lucky to be doing commercial work for Network Rail.”

Without further prompting, he continues:

“This is like a world war, only that we are not fighting other humans but this virus. See all these empty business offices. Corporations are seeing that work-from-home is working out, that the work ethics is just as good as working in the office”.

So what do you think will happen with all this office space? “People are going to continue to work from home, so some of this money should go to them, help them get a better apartments to live and work from.”

Craig seems confident in the ability of Brummies to learn and adapt to this lockdown: “We have to keep calm and carry on – not much else one can do. As for myself, I will stay open as long as I can.”

I’m reminded of the 1939 British Government poster produced in preparation for the Blitz. With more than 2 million copies printed, it was essentially left unused, only to be rediscovered in the year 2000 at a Northumberland book shop.

Maybe this tall and tattooed locksmith has the key to unlocking this lockdown. 

Maybe

I keep my calm, thank him for his time and carry on back to the street, onto the Bullring Open Market. 

It is late in the day; few masked shoppers are strolling amongst the stalls. Surely this market has seen better days. Still, this is far from lockdown city. 12 yogurts for 50p are to be had, sweet exotic fruits are on sale. The market indeed carries on. 

I find that I’m liking the city during lockdown. It lies bare in front of me, exposed, uninterrupted. 

On my way back, I come across a sign quoting Vice Admiral Horatio Nelson, a.k.a. Admiral Nelson, an eighteen century British flag officer for the Royal Navy: “England expects that every man will do his job”. 

Behind him, Christmas decorations are already taking shape at Saint Martin’s Square. 

Birmingham is indeed in lockdown, again, but this time it is different. The shock of lockdown 1 is fast fading, with life under the new regime becoming more and more a familiar routine.

Brummies are keeping calm and carrying on.

Dror Kessler, for Birmingham Eastside: with lockdown 2, key phrase 1, and a tattooed locksmith just in case you’re having too much fun.

Carry on.
