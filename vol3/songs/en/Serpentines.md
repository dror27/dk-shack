# Serpentines

It’s nothing pressing, you might be guessing\
That I’m just playing, messing with you mind\
It feels mysterious, though far from serious\
Got you all curious, about my kind\
\
But I’m just hoping, as a form of copping\
With all the ways of stopping just in time\
I’m taking cover, from being a lover\
From climbing higher, up your serpentines\
\
Yes, It’s all about the climbing, be on the rising\
Forget about them crying, keep it all inside\
Sunshine is golden, still, my throat is swollen\
From screaming “hold that moment”, from keeping rhyme\
\
But I’m just hoping ...\
\
Just roll now over, slide into my covers\
Park yourself sober, inside my arms\
I’ll lend you a shoulder, hold you while we ponder\
Surrendering, getting older, I don’t mind\
\
But I’m just hoping ...
