# Listen To Your Heart

Let me take you on a journey\
Through time\
You might think I'm happy\
Reasonably kind\
\
But all that time\
I've been scheming 'about your mind\
All that time\
I've been trying to get you from behind\
\
You might think I'm lazy,\
Well, I'm trying my best\
To get you to be crazy\
To follow all my fads\
\
I must confest\
Some of it is true\
You might analyse me\
But you'll never be through\
\
So take you time\
Listen to your heart\
Take your time\
Listen to your heart\
It might be telling you\
Now's the time to stop\
\
