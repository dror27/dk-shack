# Listen To Your Heart

(stream of consciousness)\
\
Let me take you on a journey\
Through time\
You might think I'm happy\
Reasonably kind\
\
But all that time\
I've been scheming 'about your mind\
All that time\
I've been trying to get you from behind\
\
You might think I'm lazy,\
Well, I'm trying my best\
To get you to be crazy\
To follow all my fads\
\
I must confest\
Some of it is true\
You might analyse me\
But you'll never be through\
\
So take you time\
Listen to your heart\
Take your time\
Listen to your heart\
It might be telling you\
Now's the time to stop\
\
And yet, I might be amuzing\
I might be your weekend boy\
You can hear it coming\
I'm gonna' rhyme you with a toy\
\
Better listen to your heart\
Is it say: Stop?\
Better listen to your heart\
It might be saying: better stop\
\
But your kisses are so sweet\
And you told me that I'm somthing ...\
So confusing so I thought\
There's something to be had here\
Or not\
\
You might be sequestered on a hill\
But there's something stronger than your will\
I'm gonna' climb that hill\
\
Yes, I'm rambling through this song\
You may never hear it\
But then again I might be sending it\
So you'll see there's nothing here to fear\
\
Better listen to to your heart\
If it's telling you to stay away\
Keep your distance dear,\
Honey, listen to what I'm saying
