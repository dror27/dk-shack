# Sit Down

(stream of consciousness) \
\
Sit down - put your feet back on the ground \
Sit down - put your feet back on the ground \
The train has passed \
There's not a sound \
\
Sit down - let your thoughts whittle down \
Sit down - let your thoughts whittle down \
The train has already passed by \
Pretty soon you won't even remember why \
\
Why you slid her wrist \
Why you tried to kiss \
Why you had a gun \
Oh, doesn't everyone? \
\
Sit down - plant your feet right back on the ground \
Sit down - plant your feet back right on the ground \
Pretty soon you won't hear a sound \
\
Not the sound of the night, as fallen \
Not the way that you thought you were going \
Not the way things turned out \
Well .. isn't it what it's all about? \
\
Sit down - plant your feet back on the ground \
Sit down - plant your feet back on the ground \
Pretty soon you won't hear a sound \
Pretty soon there's nobody else around \
\
No one to call your name \
No one to tell you you've insane \
No one to say: come-on, get that house \
No one to say: why ... you messed around \
No one to say: why .... you never took that job \
No one to say that you could have been hot \
Now you're talking man ... no doubt \
No one to say that you flirt and flaunt
