  # Your Baby Blues

Won't be your baby\
Won't be your baby no more\
Things are moving fast here\
Better not wait for me too long\
\
Won't rock your cradle\
I won't be rocking your cradle no more\
Play time's over kiddo\
Gotta' run and pay them tolls\
\
Ain't gonna make you happy\
Ain't gonna make you happy no more\
Car's already started\
Guess you've seen men run before\
\
So don't be crying\
Don't be crying no more\
Past is a present\
Future's knocking on your door\
