# Walk Away

Quietly you go astray\
Sneaking through the alleyways\
Nevermind the price\
You’ve always paid\
\
Surely you would find a way\
To overcome the dealer's hand\
Fold them pairs\
No need here to pretend\
\
Always right, never wrong\
You’re the man, now sing us a song\
Quietly just walk away\
From her\
\
She’s been gentle, she’s been kind\
Notebook says that she’s a find\
Quietly just walk away\
From love
