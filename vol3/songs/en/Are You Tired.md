# Are You Tired

(stream of consciousness) \
\
It's cold here at night\
And I'm not asking for a fight\
I just want to be at home\
\
You might think that I'm afraid\
To call you names, to befriend\
I'm just trying to be at home\
\
Is it a crime? is it a sin?\
Is that something you've never seen?\
Is that a face you're making?\
Or are you ... just afraid?\
\
I'm not trying to be brave\
I'm not trying to get it all, to save\
I'm just trying to be at home\
\
'Cause everything we've said and done\
May wash away, may be gone\
And I'm just trying, to get home\
\
Are you crying? are you sad?\
Is this the life you thought you had?\
Are you feeling the same pain I'm in?\
\
Are you feeling all alone?\
Waiting for me to pick up the telephone?\
Are you tired of being alone?\
\
Are you tired? are you all alone?\
Are you sitting, right now, by the telephone?\
Are waiting? or are you gone?\
\
Is it the right to call you now?\
Or should I wait until you'll tell me somehow?\
Are you feeling all alone?\
\
'Cause in a moment\
I'll be gone
