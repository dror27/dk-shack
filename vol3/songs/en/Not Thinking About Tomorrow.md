# Not Thining About Tomorrow

(stream of consciousness) \
\
There I was, undetected \
Running like the fire \
I was deeply un-alerted \
To what was going inside your mind \
\
All them thoughts were wondering \
About who I was, and who you are \
Like a herd of cows we go warnding \
Looking for an opening, in the sky \
\
Then I heard the wind calling \
And it wasn't calling your name \
I saw the river flowing \
Didn't take me to where I came \
\
The sun was rising \
This time from the west \
I was petrifying \
To the whole world, and to you, my best \
\
Here we are alone in the desert \
And I got me about two chords \
The third one seems to be missing, or is it present \
From my voice, or from it all \
\
Yet, I'm still rambling \
Like them good old days \
I see the clipping red light showing \
Is it a sign that you're not there \
\
Not thinking about tomorrow \
Not thinking about you \
Not thinking about pain or sorrow \
Not thinking about you my friend \
Not thinking about the sky \
Not thinking about that river \
Not thinking about them clouds \
Not gone for ever \
\
Just here and now \
Just here and now \
Just here and now \
Just here and now
