# Hurray New Order

A town girl falls for a journeyman her rank\
Alas must wait her turn, ‘till her landlady’s struck\
By her newly found joy, be it a prince, or just a boy\
By sheer mistake or simply luck, a rattle snake, an aardvark\
\
Hurray new order! come the shadows, come the dark\
\
For only in them, all hail can finally breaks loose\
All bodily praise, language misuse\
By our new found joy, be it love, or just foil\
By sheer mistake or simply luck, no depression, no aardvarks\
\
Hurray new order! come the shadows, come the dark\
\
Cheer the farmhouse, dank, sleazy\
Rule the night, dusk to dawn, seize it
