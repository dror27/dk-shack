# Hurray New Order

A town girl falls for a journeyman her rank\
Alas must wait her turn, ‘till her landlady’s struck\
By her new-found joy, be it a prince, or just a boy\
By sheer mistake or simply luck, a rattle snake, an aardvark\
\
Hurray new order!\
Come the shadows\
Come the dark\
\
For only in them, all hell can finally breaks loose\
All bodily praise, language misuse\
By our new-found joy, be it love, or just a foil\
By sheer mistake or simply luck, no depression, no aardvarks\
\
Hurray new order!\
Come the shadows\
Come the dark\
\
Cheer the farmhouse, dank and sleazy\
Rule the night, dusk to dawn, seize it
