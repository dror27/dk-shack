# Walking The Fire

You tried walking the fire\
Now dance around it\
Wait until it all turns into coals\
Use it up to warm yourself, body and soul\
\
Stories have been told\
All around you\
Drink your cup of poison and be sold\
Ain’t no sense in waiting around, just getting old\
\
They’re calling out your name\
Don’t stick around here\
Maybe it is too late to reform\
Supernatural got you just so far, now be gone\
\
The stakes kept getting higher\
Rock and roll\
Kneel down to the ground, where you belong\
Do yourself some justice, sleep some on your own\
\
You say you got burned\
No points for trying\
Suck it up, peal it to the bone\
Grow yourself a conscience, melt this heart of stone\
\
Life ain’t but a game\
Them stakes are higher\
Fly under the radar, in a storm\
Crash and burn together, chase away the cold\
\
Your feet, now they got burned\
Oh, but you don’t mind it\
Pour your plastic dreams into a mould\
Edge on toxic fumes, swallow as you’re told\
\
You thought you found gold\
Head first, you dived in\
Further down, straight into a hole\
Choking on your collar, asking for some more
