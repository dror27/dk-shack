# No Matter

I wake up in the morning\
Cleanup, situps, pushups\
Getting my body ready\
For you\
\
I wake up, laying in bed\
Naked as I was, then\
Thinking about the call to come\
'About the next strum\
\
For playing and lovin'\
Are quite the same here\
Move your hand up and down\
Swing your head to her rhymes\
Keep the base line going\
Slack away, sliding through time\
\
Sometimes it feels wrong\
Like a chord that's out of place\
In a perfect song, a money shakin' hit\
A single off-note will drop you out the race\
\
But we're playing the blues\
The rhythm of the soul, the punk\
Jazzing away on a folk tune\
Not caring at all, about them charts\
\
For playing ...\
\
So jingle me away Santa\
Thrush me senseless Queen\
Drink my soup,\
Wipe me clean\
\
Faking a new tune *is* true playing\
Ploughing lanes through hearts is the real thing\
Ain't no wrong,\
Ain't no sin\
\
No matter where you came from\
No matter where you've been\
\
For playing ...
