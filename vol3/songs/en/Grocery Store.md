# Grocery Store

I run my life as a grocery store\
Yesterday’s bread food for the mice\
This week’s pay a fare to see my love\
Change in my pocket booze for getting ripe\
\
If currency be your time\
My checkbook be this song\
I’ll make commitments here in verse\
Sign my name across your chest\
Slip and slide into your vest\
\
You can tear me as you like\
Crumpled, stamped upon I will bounce\
Back into the balance of your touch\
Cached round midnight I lay flush\
\
Energy is mass, that funny man said\
I concur. And as such it fades\
All but a single bulge I keep\
For drawing when the climbing's steep\
\
Philosophical antithetical, on a whim\
Chaucer wrote poems, I scheme\
\
Tomorrow’s credit, todays kill\
Bottom’s empty - round the wheel
