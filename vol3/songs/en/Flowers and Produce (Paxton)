# Flower and Produce (draft)

(lyrics: Sheila Harding)\
\
When we had our flower and produce show\
It really was quite grand\
They sent Paxton, the gardener from Chatsworth\
In case he could lend a hand\
And he brought with him lots of fancy fruit\
And we put it on a stand.\
\
Chorus\
Yes it was all highly respectable\
All very refined\
For Mr Paxton.\
\
There were peaches and nectarines and grapes\
Or so I've heard folk say.\
And a huge great basket of cherries as well\
All sent over on the day\
Perhaps those toffs thought we'd not seen the like\
Over Wirksworth way.\
Chorus\
\
There were some as thought it might put us to shame\
With our regular garden stuff\
And then a wandering minstrel arrived\
As if things weren't grand enough\
But we showed them grandees from Chatsworth\
That Wirksworth wasn't so rough.\
Chorus\
\
There were ladies in hats all dressed in their best\
In Sunday frocks and lace\
And gentlemen farmers in top coats and linen\
To smarten up the place\
The doctor, the vicar, the teacher all came\
Everyone showing their face.\
Chorus\
\
Paxton didn't scorn to judge when he saw\
What Wirksworth folk had grown\
He was right impressed and he said as much\
And t'was not his opinion alone\
For the Mercury came to write up a piece,\
It's praise was quite high flown.\
Chorus\
\
But best of all was that first prize plate\
From good old Francis Shaw\
His strawberries they were a wonder to see\
Seven inches round or more\
Mr Paxton he couldn't believe his own eyes\
Those strawberries wiped the floor. (repeat)\
Chorus
