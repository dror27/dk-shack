## Goging Without

Drove out to see you\
To break the spell\
It’s been a while since that storm\
Took me six hours\
Felt almost like a race\
Two pit stops, and a chase\
You waited by the door\
Holding on to a smile\
Midnight bells swept me in\
\
But there’s something I didn’t know\
Something that night I found out\
There are times for letting go\
And times for going without\
\
At times you feel\
Like climbing up a hill\
Steep it is  as your doubts\
The road gets long\
Your mind drifts on\
Laying memories like bath tiles\
Your body follows on\
Just like them time when you were strong\
Closing for the kill\
\
But there’s something ...\
\
You both felt into love\
And crawled your way outside\
Well, if only for a while\
\
Now you’re driving back alone\
Cruise control, headphones on\
Stealth survivor, after all\
There are no cops in sight\
It’s sunrise, early light\
Once again, you’re on your own\
If you just let be\
She will forget, maybe\
And so will you, in time\
\
But there’s something ...
