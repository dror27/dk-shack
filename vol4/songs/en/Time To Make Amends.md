# Time To Make Amends

The river is overflowing my friend\
Seems like the worst time to pretend\
Nothing wrong with the occasional disguis\
But right now, it’s just about you and I\
The river is overflowing my friend\
\
The skies are angry my friend\
There're getting tired of them bitter ends\
It's a good time as any\
To make amends, to be pleasantly canny\
The skies are angry my friend\
\
Old nature’s wondering\
Why we’re falling, again through the cracks\
He may be calling\
But you sure ain't going back\
\
This must be the after life, she says\
So you'd better let it crash and burn\
I’m getting hungry\
The house is warming finally\
Now is a good time to make amends
