# Chase Me

We’re caught in a storm\
Kids left on their own\
Folks have long been gone\
We’re caught in a storm\
Catch me, I’m home again\
\
Well, if it rains forever\
We’ll just have to stay here together\
Never mind the flights, the car\
We’ll call it a disaster natural\ 
Leave it all behind, afar,\
A perfect escape, so far, cause ...\
\
We’re caught in a storm\
Kids left on their own\
Folks have long been gone\
We’re caught in a storm\
Chase me, I’m home again\
\
Here I am again\
Repeating myself again\
Getting away with murder\
Sinking my ship, again\
In the rain, anyway ...\
\
Meanwhile, the rain’s been dying out\
Lucinda's singing, about a an angle in a rut\
Duck tape messiah\
Sure made me happy once\
Now I’m stringing dreams\
On a wire thin as dust\
\
We’re caught in a storm ...
