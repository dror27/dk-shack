# Ask The Man

Ask the man what to think\
Then you will know not a thing\
Still you keep on asking for more\
\
Ask the man where to turn\
He will lead you on and then abend\
To palaces you can’t see at all\
\
Knighted, out of phase\
Seems so estranged\
You hardly question\
\
He will tell you of secret things\
Schemes so deviant you can’t dream\
Reaching to the bowels of your great beyond\
\
He will lead you to explore\
You’re inner thoughts, your warts and all\
He will spread your mind until it’s leafy gold\
\
Preaching to the skies\
With nothing left inside\
Surprise\
\
Still a voice in your ear\
Whispers softly: have no fear\
Little birds keep chirping on\
While you keep dancing to a song\
\
Well, ask the man how he feels\
He’ll straight up tell you: I have no tears\
For you and the likes of you, for anyone at all\
\
Ask him where he’s going, he will\
Tell you ut makes not sense at all\
To question if you can not blindly follow\
\
Now you're knighted, out of phase\
Seems so strange\
You hardly question\
\
Still the bird inside your ear\
Plays a different song each year\
And your mind is thrashing happily\
On what the wind just brings in\
\
Still a voice in your head\
Whispers softly: get out of bed\
Little birds keep chirping on\
While you keep dancing to a song
