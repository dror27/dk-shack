# Living On The Run

As cars draw near\
Quickly disappear\
Jump into the ditch\
Scratch away that itch\
\
They’re calling out your name\
They're Knocking on pane\
Sifting through your mail\
Neighbor says you bailed\
\
But in the dead of night\
He was sleeping tight\
Knife by his bedside\
(you) Took him by surprise\
\
Now you’re living on the run\
Never seein’ no one\
Are we having fun\
Living on the run\
\
Silly girl they say\
You’ve blown it all away\
Should have taken it and stayed\
Silly girl they say\
\
Do they know how it feels\
To be held against your will\
In a cold dark cave\
Wishing for your grave\
\
But in the dead of night ...\
\
Now you're living on the run ...\
\
But in an instant one can turn\
From a foe into a friend\
Who then takes you by the hand\
Vowing never to pretend\
\
Now dead of night draws near\
In the distance cars you hear\
And the sky so wide and clear\
You want him to be near\
\
Still you're living on the run ...
