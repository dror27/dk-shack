# Sometimes I Get Quite When Asked

Well I've been trying a bunch of ways\
To try and tell you the way\
I feel when I wake up alone\
\
But there is nothing I could sing about\
Nothing but the quite hours\
And the mountains coming through the door\
\
Yes, It's another wonderful day here in the Alps\
Soon I will go out, walk the path\
Meet some people on the street\
They've been asking where you've been\
I'll just tell them\
I'll just tell them
