# It's True (stream of consciousness)

Sometimes I get tired, from reading all the news\
Rushing through my brain, oh, things I ought to do\
Sometimes I get weary, thinking about love
The jungle in my brain, when I'm feeling proud\
\
Sometimes I wish, to simply be\
Alone in existance, just you and me\
We'll go out riding, and come back home\
Sometimes I worry, our moment's gone\
\
But it's true, all I need is you\
It's true, I can do without the truth\
It's true, I doesn't matter much what I do\
\
Sometimes I think, we're going to miss the boat\
Dreaming about ... thinking about alot ...\
Sometimes I'm curious, then I'm not\
I can just say, that I'm in doubt\
\
Sometimes I feel, I want to be alone with you\
It will be enough, no matter what we'll do\
Write a simple love song, try to make it through\
It's true\
\
Now the house is pleasantly warm, about 20 degrees\
Pretty soon the guests will arrive, we'll be starting again soon\
A knock on the door, a couple from the sea\
Just some more familiar faces, ain't that the truth\
\
Sometimes I want to be alone, alone with you\
We won't be doing much, just hanging through\
Take a ride out to the sunset, and come back to sleep\
Do the weekend puzzle\
\
Sometimes I think, when I'm alone here with you\
There wouldn't be anything missing, just us two\
Sometimes there're nothing, I would rather do\
With you
