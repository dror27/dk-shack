# Just Don't Fight

I learned this trade from a friend\
Who just opens up the camera and just plays\
Whatever comes out he says\
I'm all right with that\
Let's do it again\
\
I learned this from a friend\
Who opens up camera and just plays\
Whatever comes out he says\
It's fine\
Let's play\
\
As Faith would want it\
I can go on chattering about nothing\
Visited a big old city today\
What I did there is nobody's asking\
\
Still I'm here\
Ready for the kill\
With all them same chords\
About ready to tell you how I feel\
\
So much hatred, so much disgust\
Haven't you people just had enough?\
\
let's go outside, let's run wild\
Seek and hide, whatever you like\
Just don't fight
