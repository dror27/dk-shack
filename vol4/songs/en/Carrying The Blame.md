# Carrying The Blame

Daddy worked the highway\
Up and down the coast\
Then one night it just happened\
Sometimes a man gets lost\
The found his car, all crumpled up\
In a ditch, 'round the bend\
There was no sign of a body\
No letter left for a friend\
\
Someone said they saw him working in a bar\
Somewhere out of sight, someplace real far\
Breathing heavy, under a new name\
I guess it got too heavy\
Carrying the blame\
\
We pitched a tent, said our goodbyes\
Folk came from from out of town\
Mom, she cried for a whole straight hour\
then got up and said it's time\
To live it up, to be free\
Just like we'd wanna be\
Dad's soul in heaven rests\
Got to go to work, be my best\
\
Someone said they saw him ...\
\
Two teenages, locked up in a jam\
Mom's pregnent, Dad's to blame\
Shotgun wedding, in the yard\
Baby's crying, times got hard\
Still the spirit kept the light\
In their hearts, in the dark\
Love was just a place to park\
Noq they're running, damn the cards\
\
Someone said they saw him ...\
\
Now my baby's crying\
Man, I don't know why\
Grandpa's been dying\
For a whole damn while\
\
Once I thought I saw him working in a bar\
Somewhere out of sight, someplace real far\
Breathing heavy, under a new name\
I guess it got too heavy\
Carrying the blame
